BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS2018  LIST OF GOODS PRODUCED BY CHILD LABOR OR FORCED LABORForeword
When the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau 

of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) began 
researching international child labor 25 years 
ago, information moved slowly. Policy analysts placed 
phone calls to overseas organizations and waited for 
faxes from foreign governments. This was all to shed 
more light on a problem that mostly existed in the dark, 
and global estimates on the magnitude of child labor did 
not yet exist. The result was the first ILAB child labor 
report, By the Sweat & Toil of Children, which was mailed 
to hundreds of locations across the globe.

Today, information moves faster, and the knowledge 
base is broader. Sweat & Toil is now an app, available on 
iTunes and Google Play, that aggregates over 1,000 pages 
of child labor and forced labor research. 

This is an “Age of Acceleration.” Technology is changing 
the way we live and work, and inventors and companies 
are spearheading innovation to improve our lives. Yet, 
a relic of the previous era persists: 152 million child 
laborers and 25 million forced laborers are estimated to 
still sweat and toil worldwide. These adults and children 
work in hazardous, abusive, or even slave-like conditions. 
And U.S. workers have been left to compete on an uneven 
playing field. 

R. Alexander Acosta, U.S. Secretary of Labor

The United States should not have to compete with other 
countries that fail to play by the rules, and seek an unfair 
advantage by turning a blind eye to labor abuses. Trade 
between nations should be fair, and profits should not come 
from the backs of children or slaves. The cost of child labor 
and forced labor is simply too high for all involved.

I am proud to release the 17th edition of the annual 
Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor, and the 8th 
edition of the List of Goods Produced by Child Labor 
or Forced Labor—the flagship reports in the series we 
began publishing 25 years ago. The research in these 
reports helps shine a light on these conditions overseas, 
and offers concrete actions U.S. trading partners can 
take to accelerate efforts to eliminate child labor and 
forced labor. While there has been significant progress 
over the last two decades, including 94 million fewer 
child laborers estimated today than there were in 
2000, these reports show us that we need to accelerate 
progress toward ending child labor, forced labor, human 
trafficking, and modern slavery. This is vital if we are to 
make trade fair for all. 

American workers cannot compete with producers 
abroad who use child labor or forced labor, provide 
unsafe working conditions, or do not pay workers what 
they are legally owed. These reprehensible practices 
undercut the higher standards we maintain to protect the 
well-being of our workforce here at home. 

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRSAccelerating progress means intensifying efforts on 
what we are already doing and what we know works. 
That means enforcing trade commitments, strengthening 
labor standards, and removing children from dangerous 
or demeaning work that robs them of their childhoods. 
This means prosecuting and holding accountable those 
individuals who force children to traffic drugs, wage 
battle as part of armed groups, or perform sex acts. It 
means permanently shuttering dishonest recruitment 
agencies and illicit companies that lure workers with false 
promises of decent work into abhorrent conditions of 
forced labor. And as we intensify our efforts, we must also 
seek innovations and creative solutions to more effectively 
address these challenges.

At the U.S. Department of Labor and across federal 
agencies, we are doing our part to accelerate progress on 
these issues. Here at home, our Wage and Hour Division 
investigated 750 cases with child labor violations last year, 
and debarred employers from applying for certification to 
request temporary foreign workers due to frequent abuse 
of workers in the H-2A agricultural worker visa program. 
Our Occupational Safety and Health inspectors have also 
assessed thousands of dollars in civil penalties for failing to 
protect employees from falls and other safety hazards. We 
must also seek innovations and creative solutions to more 
effectively address these challenges. Businesses can also 
accelerate progress by using our data and consulting our 
Comply Chain app, now available in Spanish and French, to 
be vigilant and dig deeper in their supply chains to ensure 
that child labor and forced labor are not in the mix of goods 
or services they offer.

In May of 2018, the Department of Homeland Security’s 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) used ILAB’s 
extensive research documenting the use of forced 
labor in the production of cotton from Turkmenistan in 
making the historic decision to block all goods made with 
Turkmen cotton from entering the United States. The 
message here is clear: If you are a trading partner that 
does not abide by and uphold your commitments to end 
child labor or forced labor, the U.S. will do what it takes to 
protect vulnerable workers from exploitation, safeguard 
American jobs, and create a fair playing field for countries 
that play by the rules.

Like the rest of the international community, as 
communicated in the G20 Labor and Employment 
Ministers’ Hamburg Declaration, the United States 
acknowledges that meeting the ambitious goal of ending 
child labor, forced labor, human trafficking, and all forms 
of modern slavery requires that we accelerate the very 
real progress that has been made over the past quarter-
century. In this Age of Acceleration, we must keep pace 
by forging new partnerships, introducing innovations, and 
accelerating actions that take us closer to a world free of 
child labor and forced labor. 

It is my hope that these reports will provide you with 
a renewed sense of urgency to continue this fight and 
bring others along who will join us in the race toward fair 
global trade—one that gives children their childhoods, 
forced laborers their freedom, and U.S. workers a fair 
playing field. 

R. ALEXANDER ACOSTA
Secretary of Labor
September 2018

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS2018  LIST OF GOODS PRODUCED BY CHILD LABOR OR FORCED LABORWhen Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta named 

me to be Deputy Undersecretary for International 
Affairs in September 2017, it was my great honor 
to return to a bureau I had departed over 10 years earlier, 
but whose mission had never left me. My return marked 
the 70th anniversary of the Bureau of International Labor 
Affairs, or ILAB, as we call it. While our work, like the 
world, may look very different today than it did in 1947 
or even in 2006, it still serves the same vital purpose: 
to help ensure a fair playing field for U.S. workers and 
businesses by improving labor standards overseas. 

“The Age of Acceleration” Secretary Acosta mentioned 
has resulted in the swift rise of international trade and 
increasingly complex global supply chains. Yet we must 
ensure that as we accelerate, we also leave behind 
backward practices like child labor and forced labor.

Whether these abusive labor practices are checked 
or unchecked, the existence of child labor and forced 
labor run counter to our values as a nation. We want 
the goods we consume to be made by workers free from 
exploitation, not made by children or slaves. We also want 
workers in the U.S. to be able to compete on a fair global 
playing field.

Martha E. Newton, Deputy Undersecretary 
for International Affairs

That is why Secretary Acosta is committed to seeing 
accelerated action among our trade partners, including 
stronger enforcement against labor violations and 
demonstrated action to protect workers and children, 
especially those most vulnerable to exploitation. I am 
particularly proud that creating the knowledge base for 
such accelerated action is one of ILAB’s key contributions 
to the global effort to protect workers around the word.

Over the past 25 years, ILAB’s Office of Child Labor, 
Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking has been providing 
groundbreaking and influential research that equips 
governments, workers, businesses, and civil society with 
the information they need to take effective action against 
labor exploitation. 

And we’re not resting on our laurels. The country 
assessments in this year’s Findings on the Worst 
Forms of Child Labor report, mandated by the Trade 
and Development Act of 2000, are based on the most 
stringent criteria ever. In order to earn a “Significant 
Advancement” assessment, a country must establish a 
basic floor of labor protections. This year, there were 
14 countries that achieved this distinction, including 
Colombia, Paraguay, and India.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRSOf the approximately 1,700 country-specific suggested 
actions in this report, 1,100 of them are directed at 
improving laws and strengthening enforcement, providing 
a roadmap for over 140 governments to follow to accelerate 
progress in eliminating child labor in their own countries.

These are concrete actions governments can take to 
accelerate change and improve lives. The Government of 
Uzbekistan’s work with the international community to 
significantly reduce the forced mobilization of children in 
the cotton fields is one example of how such change can 
and does happen. We commend this effort and appeal to 
the government to build on it by extending protections 
to adults who are forced to work under the threat of 
retaliation.

Our List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced 
Labor, mandated by the Trafficking Victims Protection 
Reauthorization Act of 2005, also provides vital 
information for both governments and businesses to 
accelerate change in improving the lives of workers 
abroad and creating a level playing field. The 2018 
edition covers 148 goods in 76 countries. This includes 
the addition of 10 new goods, including some goods that 
consumers in the United States use every day, such as 
peppers from Mexico and mica from India. 

By pinpointing specific industries where child labor 
and forced labor are occurring, the report equips 
governments and companies with information to help 
them target appropriate policy responses or direct 
resources as part of due-diligence or risk-management 

systems. While there are new goods from the 
governments of Brazil, El Salvador, and Paraguay, it is 
because they have proactively invested resources and 
collected and used their own data to determine where 
they can be most effective in addressing labor abuses in 
their own countries. Their commitment to data-driven 
policy-making serves as an example to other countries 
working to end child labor and forced labor, and these 
governments should be commended for these efforts.

Consumers, too, are growing more savvy and selective 
in their purchases—demanding not only quality products 
but responsible production practices—and social 
entrepreneurs are channeling the report’s data into 
point-of-sale tools to inform purchases. ILAB welcomes 
this virtuous cycle of consumer advocacy and business 
response to consumer demand, as it gets more people 
involved, who can be a part of the solution.

Twenty years ago, 7 million people marched across 5 
continents in the Global March Against Child Labor. 
The spirit of that march continues today, and must 
energize our collective commitment to march on behalf 
of the 152 million children still in child labor and 25 
million adults and children in forced labor. As we seek 
inspiration from the past, let us recommit ourselves and 
show a renewed sense of purpose to accelerate progress 
toward the goal of eliminating child labor and forced 
labor.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRSPurpose of this Report

The U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) has produced this eighth edition of the List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced 
Labor in accordance with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPRA), as amended. The TVPRA requires USDOL’s Bureau 
of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) to “develop and make available to the public a list of goods from countries that [ILAB] has 
reason to believe are produced by forced labor or child labor in violation of international standards” 22 U.S.C. § 7112(b)(2)(C) 
(TVPRA List or the List). It also requires submission of the TVPRA List to Congress not later than December 1, 2014, and every 
two years thereafter. 22 U.S.C. § 7112(b)(3).

The TVPRA directs ILAB “to work with persons who are involved in the production of goods on the list … to create a standard 
set of practices that will reduce the likelihood that such persons will produce goods using [child labor or forced labor],” and “to 
consult with other departments and agencies of the United States Government to reduce forced and child labor internationally and 
ensure that products made by forced labor and child labor in violation of international standards are not imported into the United 
States.” 22 U.S.C. § 7112(b)(2)(D)-(E).

Research Focus

The research methodology used to compile the TVPRA List is 
based on ILAB’s Procedural Guidelines. (See Appendix 3.) For 
this edition, ILAB reviewed new information on goods from 
153 countries and territories. A list of these countries and 
territories can be found on ILAB’s Web site. ILAB continues to 
carry out research for future editions of the TVPRA List.

Population Covered
In researching child labor, ILAB focused on children under 
the age of 18 years. For forced labor, the research covered 
workers of all ages. The population included persons in foreign 
countries only, as directed by statute. Populations within the 
United States were not included in this study.

Reporting Period
In developing the TVPRA List, ILAB generally relied on sources 
that are no more than five years old at the time of receipt. This 
policy is to ensure consistency with other ILAB reporting on 
international child labor.

Type of Work
Research covered all economic activity for adults and children 
in the production of goods, including formal and informal 
sector production and goods produced for personal and family 
consumption. Examples of informal sector activity include day 
labor hired without contract; small-scale farming and fishing; 
artisanal mining and quarrying; and manufacturing work 
performed in home-based workshops. Some illicit goods are 
also included in the TVPRA List; this is not intended to condone 
or legitimize the production or consumption of these goods.

Sources Used
To make determinations about the List, ILAB relies upon a 
wide variety of publicly-available primary and secondary 
sources. Our primary sources included surveys carried out by 
foreign governments in conjunction with the ILO; site visits 
and data gathered by ILAB staff and other U.S. Government 
personnel; and quantitative and qualitative studies carried out 
by a variety of governmental and nongovernmental entities, 
including academic institutions.

See Appendix 2 for the full TVPRA List Methodology.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRSData for Good:
The 2018 List of Goods Produced by Child Labor 
or Forced Labor

An exposé in a major international newspaper finds 7- and 
8-year-old children sewing clothing for 60 hours a week.1 
A video, widely shared on social media, features a child 
describing an open-pit gold mine collapsing on top of him.2 
Several electronics factory workers commit suicide, making 
headlines around the world and sparking allegations of 
forced labor.3 Consumers boycott well-known food and 
beverage brands due to watchdog reports of exploitative 
working conditions and child labor on palm oil plantations.4 
International organizations express concern over the 
continuing practice of hereditary slavery in certain countries, 
leading those governments to commit to international 
standards on forced labor.5 

Child labor and forced labor are global realities, increasingly 
documented by researchers and the media, understood by 
consumers, and acknowledged by governments. The numbers 
are clear and striking: the International Labor Organization 
(ILO) estimates that at least 152 million children are in child 
labor and 25 million people are in forced labor worldwide. 
While child labor has declined by 94 million over the past 
two decades, we are still learning about the true magnitude of 
forced labor. Box 1 provides further detail on the ILO’s 2017 
global estimates.

Sometimes these abuses happen behind closed doors, and 
other times they are hidden in plain sight. A family with 
children harvesting crops may seem, on the surface, very 
ordinary; in reality, the family may be in debt bondage to 
a landowner or employer, unable to escape. A teenage boy 
fishing on a boat is an everyday sight in Southeast Asia; yet he 
may have been trafficked there—tricked, threatened, or even 
drugged into submission. 

Yet we do have knowledge that can help bring these 
underlying realities to the surface. We know, for example, the 
conditions that make people most vulnerable to these abuses. 
Those most vulnerable to child labor are from impoverished 
families or communities, in rural areas and in the informal 
economy, or living in crisis situations resulting from conflicts 
or disasters.6 Those most vulnerable to forced labor work in 
low-wage jobs, informal workplaces, or industries with many 
layers of subcontracting that decrease visibility, transparency, 
and accountability for abuses.7 We also know the warning 
signs of forced labor, and it is important to be able to 
recognize these hallmarks so that workers can seek help and 
others can help identify victims. (See Box 2.) 

BOX 1

International Labor Organization Global Estimates  
on Child Labor and Forced Labor

Of the 152 million children in child labor 
in 2016:
•  73 million were in hazardous work
•  Over 70 percent worked in agriculture
•  48 percent were below age 12
•  58 percent were boys

Of the 25 million people in forced labor 
in 2016:
•  64 percent were in the Asia-Pacific region
•  Over 8 million experienced debt bondage
•    Over 4 million were in government-imposed 

forced labor

providers, the media, and other stakeholders are creating and 
using a proliferation of information and technologies to attack 
the problems of child labor and forced labor from multiple 
angles.

By publishing the TVPRA List, the U.S. Department of Labor’s 
(USDOL) Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) seeks 
to stimulate action to address labor abuses in the listed 
countries, and in other countries where information may not 
be available, but where these abuses are an everyday reality. 
This publication helps to curtail these abuses globally, but also 
helps ensure that American workers and companies do not 
face unfair competition from overseas counterparts that do 
not respect basic labor rights. Simply put, the purpose of this 
report is to help end child labor and forced labor. From garment 
production in Burma and Turkey, to mica mining in India, to 
chile pepper cultivation in Mexico, this 2018 edition of the 
TVPRA List brings new awareness of abuses occurring around 
the world. Since 2009, this report has been one of the USDOL’s 
key tools for shifting momentum from inaction to action. 

The mission of the Bureau of 
International Labor Affairs is 
to promote a fair global playing 
field for workers in the United 
States and around the world by 
enforcing trade commitments, 
strengthening labor standards, 
and combating international 
child labor, forced labor, 
and human trafficking.

BOX 2

Selected Indicators of 
Forced Labor
•  Coercive recruitment
•  Deception about the nature of work
•   Confiscation of identity papers or  travel 

documents

•  Physical or sexual violence
•  Forced overtime
•   Limited freedom of movement or 

communication

•  Withholding or delay of wages
•  Denunciation to authorities
•   No freedom to resign in accordance with 

legal requirements

estimate forced labour of adults and children. 2012.

Amid a proliferation of credible research, consumer attention, 
and on-the-ground efforts to tackle child labor and forced labor, 
turning a blind eye is no longer an option. Governments that do 
not acknowledge or address these problems will confront them 
in trade negotiations, trade enforcement actions, or multilateral 
fora. CEOs who turn a blind eye to labor exploitation will face 
the issue in shareholder resolutions or face questions from 
their Boards. These stakeholders and others who stay on the 
sidelines of this issue could end up in the headlines.

As public pressure mounts, the momentum is shifting toward 
positive change: from denial to ownership and from finger-
pointing to collaborative action. With support from donors and 
international organizations, governments are moving toward 
robust data collection and dissemination, stronger laws, better 
enforcement, and more effective services to victims. Unions 
and other worker representative organizations are educating 
workers about their rights and increasing their access to 
remedies for abuses. The private sector is applying technology 
to find new ways to mitigate risks, identify victims, and provide

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRSAbout this Report

This report begins with the full 2018 TVPRA List and an 
analysis of what the sectors and countries on the List tell us 
about child labor and forced labor in the world today. We then 
present the 2018 additions to the List and discuss not only 
key findings, but also the source materials that are critical to 
bringing these issues into the open. Next, we look in depth at 
this year’s removals from the List, discussing the factors that 
contributed to the reduction or elimination of child labor or 
forced labor in each case. Finally, we point to notable efforts 
that governments, the private sector, social partners and civil 
society, and multilateral organizations are undertaking to 
eradicate these problems, and examine what still needs to be 
done to achieve our goals.

Full Transparency: 
The TVPRA Bibliography
In an effort to maintain full transparency, USDOL 
publishes a bibliography of the sources (studies, 
articles, reports, publications, communications, etc.) 
that were used in reaching the determination to add 
each good to the List. The bibliography for the full 
List can be found on the ILAB Web site at http://
www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods. 
All of the sources in the bibliography are publicly 
available. Many can easily be found on the Internet. 
Readers may also request a copy of any source from 
ILAB, by sending an e-mail to ilab-tvpra@dol.gov. 
Bibliographies for all new goods added to the List in 
2018 can be found in Appendix 1.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS2018  LIST OF GOODS PRODUCED BY CHILD LABOR OR FORCED LABORFigure 2

Think About It

Do you know how your favorite goods are made? You may be surprised to learn 

that items you use every day may be produced by child or forced labor. 

COFFEE AND SUGAR. There 
is evidence of child labor or 
forced labor in sugarcane 
and coffee harvesting in 
a combined 25 countries 
worldwide. Workers, some 
of them trafficked or in 
debt bondage, toil for long 
hours in the heat. They often 
lack protective equipment, 
increasing the risk of 
physical injury and exposure 
to chemicals. 

CELL PHONE. Children in 
the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo labor in 
harsh and dangerous 
conditions to mine cobalt 
ore, a mineral essential 
to the rechargeable 
lithium-ion batteries in 
our cell phones, laptops, 
and electric cars.

GOLD. Children mine gold 
underwater or along river 
shorelines, using oxygen tubes 
to breathe; they process gold 
using mercury, a poisonous 
substance, which causes 
irreversible damage to their 
health. Twenty-two countries 
are known to use child labor or 
forced labor in gold, the most 
of any good on the List.

CHOCOLATE DESSERT. Adults and 
children are forced to harvest palm 
oil, an ingredient found in nearly 50% 
of packaged supermarket products, 
and cocoa, the main ingredient in 
chocolate. According to a 2013/14  
report from Tulane University, there 
are an estimated 2 million children 
working in the cocoa sector in 
West Africa.

CLOTHES. Labor 
abuse of children and 
adults in garment 
manufacturing occurs 
in numerous countries 
from South America 
to Southeast Asia. 
From simple T-shirts 
to luxury eveningwear, 
your clothes may have 
been cut, stitched, 
or embellished by an 
exploited worker. 

TOYS. Both child labor 
and forced labor are found 
in the manufacturing of 
toys in China. The toys 
in our children’s hands 
may have been handled 
by another child: one for 
whom work takes the 
place of play. 

SUSHI. Child  labor and forced 
labor is used to catch and 
process fish and seafood 
in oceans, lakes, farms, and 
processing facilities around 
the world. Workers are coerced 
into working on fishing vessels, 
forced to fish for up to 22 hours 
a day with little or no pay, and 
subjected to threats and severe 
physical abuse. 

MAKEUP. Children 
in India face health 
and safety hazards 
mining mica, a mineral 
commonly found in 
lipstick, eye shadow, face 
powder, and nail polish. 

LEATHER. Children are 
exposed to hazardous 
working conditions in the 
leather tanning industry in 
Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, 
and Vietnam. This leather is 
used to produce handbags 
and other goods.

SHOES. Footwear 
manufacturing, primarily 
in Asia, has a documented 
child labor problem. 
Children are more 
likely to be involved 
when production is 
subcontracted from formal 
factories to informal 
workplaces, making it 
harder to detect and deter.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRSAnalysis of Additions to the List

Table 3 shows the new line items being added to the List in 2018. For full paragraph descriptions of each good being added to 
the List in 2018, see Appendix 1. Aligning with the ILO’s findings regarding the prevalence of child labor in rural, agricultural 
economies, approximately 78 percent of the List’s new additions are agricultural goods, while 13 percent are manufactured goods 
and 9 percent are mined.

Those agricultural supply chains are also tied to other forms of exploitation. Mexican poppies, like the poppies from Afghanistan 
already on the List, are the principal ingredient in heroin. Deeply impoverished families, many in the Mexican state of Guerrero, 
grow opium poppies in a business dominated by Mexican drug cartels, which sometimes results in violence.9  Among the new 
agricultural listings are tomatoes (forced labor), chile peppers (forced labor), and poppies (child labor) from Mexico. The United 
States is Mexico’s principal agricultural trading partner, receiving nearly 80 percent of Mexico’s agricultural exports; in 2016, 
the U.S. imported nearly $24 billion in agricultural products from across the southern border.8 In effect, our salsa, ketchup, or 
pizza—all containing tomatoes or chile peppers—may be tainted with forced labor. (See Figure 2.)

21

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRSThe List’s new additions also include one good produced 
by expatriate North Korean workers—timber from Russia. 
Worldwide, there are an estimated 100,000 North Korean 
citizens sent by the North Korean regime to work in 
approximately 42 countries, the majority in Russia and China.10 
(See Figure 3.) These workers are employed in a variety of 
sectors, which include, but are not limited to, construction; 
seafood processing; logging; textile, apparel and footwear 
manufacturing; pharmaceuticals; and shipbuilding.11 They are 
compelled by their government to do this work, and their wages 
are mostly channeled back to North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, 
to support the regime.12 

For the vast majority of goods (33 of the 46 new line 
items) being added to the List, ILAB’s evidence comes from 
nationally-representative child labor prevalence surveys 
conducted by, or with the support of, national governments. 
Since 1995, ILAB has partnered with governments around 
the world to collect robust, actionable data—resulting in 
the collection and analysis of over 100 national household 
surveys worldwide. Over this time, we have seen the integral 

role robust data have played in empowering governments 
with the information needed to inform effective action. The 
governments of Paraguay, Brazil, El Salvador, and Eswatini 
have made commendable efforts in this regard, using data 
they have collected to develop evidence-based policies 
and programs to address child labor in their countries. By 
collecting this data and, just as critically, releasing survey 
results publicly, these governments have shown their 
commitment to ending forced labor and child labor and served 
as an example to other countries seeking to use data to protect 
their most vulnerable children. The addition of goods from 
these countries to the List should not be viewed as a punitive 
action, but rather as recognition that these governments value 
transparency and are making significant efforts to address 
these labor abuses. 

In addition to nationally-representative prevalence surveys, 
ILAB has also supported qualitative and mixed-methods 
research on topics critical to stakeholders. See Box 4 for an 
example of an ILAB-funded qualitative study on the labor 
recruitment industry. 

BOX 4

The Labor Recruitment Experience in Nepal, Paraguay, and Kenya

Responsible recruitment is a process that assists companies with finding the right workers and assisting workers with finding 
decent jobs. Yet all too often in the global economy, the recruitment process provides an opportunity for exploitation to 
unscrupulous actors. The recruitment process often lacks transparency or a clear line of accountability for the actors involved to 
uphold worker protections. When employers use third-party labor recruiters, they risk losing control of the recruitment process, 
particularly if it diffuses across several agencies and agents, each fulfilling discrete roles and many charging associated fees. 
One agency may recruit workers, while another transports workers to the job site, while yet a different agency is responsible for 
their documentation and overseeing their employment contracts. Informality in the process can also make it challenging to bring 
recruitment processes into compliance with international guidelines. 

To better understand these dynamics, ILAB provided support to the ILO to study the risk factors for exploitation in labor 
recruitment processes in Nepal, Paraguay, and Kenya. This qualitative study examined recruitment from Nepal into Malaysia 
and into countries in the Middle East; recruitment from Paraguay to Brazil; and recruitment from Kenya into countries in the 
Middle East. Researchers interviewed workers, labor recruiters, government officials, and civil society representatives to 
better understand how and why recruitment firms engage in abusive business practices as well as why the recruitment industry 
predominates in some national contexts and not in others. 

In the cases of the Nepal to Malaysia and Middle East corridor and the Kenya to Middle East corridor, where recruitment 
agencies are often used, the report found there was widespread non-compliance by licensed recruiters with legal and policy 
frameworks; few penalties applied by authorities; systemic illegal recruitment; and the ability to legally charge recruitment 
fees. In the Paraguay to Brazil corridor, the study found that informal networks of friends and family played a large role in 
helping workers find jobs and in organizing travel and accommodation. Additionally, the report noted that travel between the 
two countries is inexpensive, and easy to arrange. These findings suggest further research should be done into the impacts of 
informal recruitment networks in terms of protecting migrant workers’ rights, as well as how to better address regulatory and 
enforcement gaps.

Overseas Laborers 

In July 2018, the Department of State, Department of the Treasury, and Department of Homeland Security 

issued an advisory that listed countries where North Korean laborers are present, indicating 

heightened risk of forced labor. The North Korean government reportedly earns hundreds of millions of dollars 

each year from its citizens working overseas. Foreign employers pay salaries directly to the North Korean 

government, or workers are forced to relinquish 70-90% of their earnings to the authorities. 

These revenues are used to support the regime.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS2018  LIST OF GOODS PRODUCED BY CHILD LABOR OR FORCED LABORIn some cases, ILAB-funded research has been used to 
support removals from the TVPRA List. In 2018, ILAB funded 
a mixed-methods research study in Panama that found no 
more than an isolated incidence of child labor in sugarcane, 
directly leading to the removal of that good from the TVPRA 
List. ILAB also funded a rural agricultural survey in Paraguay 
that found no children working in cotton, evidence which 
supports the removal of that good from the List this year. 
These cases clearly illustrate that information on child labor 
and forced labor is useful not only to highlight problems that 
need to be addressed, but also for tracking progress toward 
achieving our common goal of ending such abusive labor 
practices.

Mica, a mineral frequently used for cosmetics, automobiles, and 
electronics, is a new addition to the 29 mined and quarried 

goods already on the List. Child labor and forced labor in 
mining, particularly in the extraction of minerals, has been 
increasingly recognized as a widespread and serious issue. Box 
5 discusses efforts currently underway to address child labor 
in India’s mica mines, and Figure 4 shows how our lives are 
touched by various tainted minerals. 

The additions of garments from Turkey and Burma join eight 
garment and textile related listings. Globally, it is widely 
recognized that the garment industry’s business model is 
vulnerable to labor abuses. The industry’s short turnaround cycle 
between order and delivery leads producers to subcontract 
production to informal workplaces, where abuses often hide. 
And consumer demand for low-cost clothing squeezes producers’ 
profit margins, often resulting in very low pay or exploitative 
payment practices.13 Box 6 discusses efforts ongoing in one 
garment-producing country to address these challenges.

BOX 5

Toward Responsible Mica 
Production in India

From glittery eye shadow to flashy car paint, mica is a mineral used 
in a number of the products consumers buy, including cosmetics, 
automobiles, and electronics. Reportedly, 25 percent of the world’s 
mica production originates from the Indian states of Bihar and 
Jharkhand, where child labor and hazardous working conditions 
are pervasive in informal mining and collecting operations which 
have not been permitted by the government. 

In 2017, over 40 companies and NGOs established the Responsible 
Mica Initiative (RMI), committing its members to achieving a 
responsible mica supply chain over the next five years. The 
initiative seeks to work closely with producers to implement 
sustainable collection, processing, and sourcing practices, as well 
as to improve supply chain traceability. Through the initiative, 
members are investing in community-building activities to 
address the underlying causes of labor violations. These activities 
complement sustainable procurement practices that many 
sourcing companies are already implementing. For example, 
RMI member L’Oréal works with a limited number of suppliers 
who commit to sourcing mica from legal, gated mines, where 
working conditions and human rights, including the prevention 
and elimination of child labor, can be monitored by independent 
compliance auditors. Finally, the RMI seeks to work together with 
the Indian government and local authorities to bring about lasting 
change in the industry. 

Media reports indicate that the Government of India plans to 
adopt legislation to permit mining by regulated operators in 
currently abandoned mines or areas where informal mining 
activity is taking place, to help reduce the chances that children 
will be employed in these areas. Stakeholders hope that by 
legalizing and regulating this industry, the wages and livelihoods of 
workers will improve, and the use of child labor will be significantly 
reduced.

The Bad News About Bling

From the mining of precious metals and gems from the earth, to the final polishing, a child or a slave could have 

had a hand in producing the jewelry that adorns red carpet-walkers and shines from newlyweds’ fingers. 

Child labor and forced labor can be found at every step along the jewelry supply chain.

Glimmering in a shop window to catch the eyes of shoppers, the beauty of

a necklace, bracelet, or pair of earrings may mask a darker reality.

Ask your jeweler what steps they are taking to keep exploitation
from tainting this luxury good—and show off your bling with pride!

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS2018  LIST OF GOODS PRODUCED BY CHILD LABOR OR FORCED LABORBOX 6
Supporting Efforts 
to End Child Labor 
in Burma’s Garment 
Industry

While the 2018 TVPRA List adds child 
labor in garment production in Burma, 
the garment industry has been active in 
combatting this issue for several years. 
Since 2014, the Myanmar Garments 
Manufacturing Association (MGMA) 
has been working to combat child 
labor, including with the assistance of 
the ILAB-funded Myanmar Program 
on the Elimination of Child Labor. 
The MGMA has organized seminars 
for its members to raise awareness 
about child labor and find ways to 
mainstream the issue into its Code of 
Conduct and 10-year Industry Strategy 
(2015-2024). Through these efforts, 
the Code now requires companies to 
implement effective age-verification 
procedures during recruitment. It also 
requires that children of legal working 
age not perform hazardous work, 
prohibiting them from using fabric-
cutting machines, certain chemicals, 
and working during night hours.

More recently, the MGMA has 
drafted a Framework of Action for 
preventing and remediating child 
labor in the garment industry, which 
includes broad strategies and 
specific actions that can be taken by 
employers, the government and local 
authorities, workers’ organizations, 
and civil society organizations. 
While these efforts are a work in 
progress, these steps demonstrate 
the industry’s growing understanding 
of and commitment to meaningfully 
addressing child labor.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRSAnalysis of Removals from the List

This edition removes one good (physic nuts) and a total of 
four line items from the List, as discussed below. Removals 
from the List demonstrate that governments, companies, 
industry groups, social partners, and civil society groups, 
working individually or collectively to eradicate child labor 
and forced labor, can have a dramatic impact. According to 
the Procedural Guidelines governing the TVPRA List (see 
Appendix 3), ILAB must have evidence that demonstrates that 
there is no significant incidence of child labor or forced labor 
in the production of a particular good in a particular country 
in question for it to be removed from the List. In reviewing 
goods for possible removal, ILAB carefully examines evidence 
of all stakeholders’ efforts, evaluating whether they have been 
effective in significantly reducing or eliminating the problem.

The way to significantly reduce or eliminate child labor or 
forced labor varies from good to good and from country 
to country. Solutions must be designed to fit each context 
and must account for a variety of factors, such as the legal, 
regulatory, and enforcement context; the number of producers 
of a particular good in a country; the structure of supply 
chains; geography; infrastructure; and the social programs in 
place to assist victims. Solutions rarely result from unilateral 
action and, instead, often are cross-sectoral and collaborative, 
leveraging the unique strengths, resources, and positions of 
multiple stakeholders. Figure 5 provides more information on 
what type of information ILAB considers when reviewing goods 
for possible removal. 

ILAB welcomes comments relating to any good on the List, 
and to date ILAB has received hundreds of comments.14 In 
some cases, commenters have contended that a good should 
be removed from the List, but have not provided sufficient 
evidence that the problem of child or forced labor has been 
significantly reduced or eliminated. The examples below 
demonstrate the evidence that ILAB considers sufficient to 
remove a good from the List.

Forced Labor in Physic 
Nut Production in Burma

In 2018, USDOL determined that the incidence of forced 
labor in the production of physic nuts in Burma has been 
eliminated, and available evidence supports the removal of 
this good from the TVPRA List. When ILAB placed physic nuts 
from Burma on the TVPRA List in 2009, evidence indicated 
that Burma’s military dictatorship ordered villagers and 
households throughout Burma to grow physic nut plants 
for biofuel production.15 Local government authorities 

implemented the program by requiring communities to plant 
physic nuts, including civil servants on government facilities, 
army units on military farms, and households on village and 
township plantations. They ordered that physic nuts be grown 
in all empty spaces, including along highways and roads, in 
house gardens, and cemeteries. Villagers and households 
were required to pay fines, or have their land confiscated by 
government officials if they did not grow physic nut plants.16

However, since 2012, human rights organizations and the 
ILO have not received reports or documented cases of forced 
labor in physic nuts. According to expert interviews and news 
reports, all production of physic nuts in Burma has ceased 
due to the failure of the government’s agricultural promotion 
program. Reportedly, program mismanagement and poor crop 
production led to the demise of the program and the end of 
physic nut production in Burma.17 In 2017, ILAB determined 
that forced labor is no longer used in the production of physic 
nuts due to a lack of evidence that this crop is currently being 
produced in Burma.

Child Labor in Sugarcane 
Production in Panama

In 2018, USDOL determined that the incidence of child labor in 
the production of sugarcane in Panama has been significantly 
reduced, and available evidence supports the removal of child 
labor in the production of this good from the TVPRA List. When 
USDOL placed this good on the TVPRA List in 2009, USDOL’s 
sources indicated that children, including indigenous Ngäbe 
Bugle children, worked in the harvesting of sugarcane. In 2014-
2015, USDOL received reports indicating that child labor in the 
production of sugarcane was no longer a significant problem in 
Panama, and began an assessment of the situation.

USDOL carried out desk research, travel to Panama, and 
telephone interviews with experts. Some sources indicated 
that child labor still occurred in the production of sugarcane; 
however, USDOL was unable to determine whether this was 
occurring beyond isolated incidents. USDOL provided funding 
through the MAP16 project for a mixed-methods study 
conducted by the ILO during the 2018 sugarcane harvest to 
understand the current situation of child labor in the industry.18 
The study included a survey with sugarcane workers, their 
children and families; focus groups with children and adults 
in sugarcane workers’ home communities; interviews with 
experts including government officials and sugarcane industry 
representatives; and a desk review.

         ILAB examines all available data on the prevalence of child or forced labor in the production of the good. If such data 
1
are not publicly available, ILAB may request it from stakeholders or support new data collection efforts. In examining 
this data, ILAB seeks to confirm whether child or forced labor is occurring in “more than an isolated incident.”

         If available data indicates that the prevalence of child or forced labor falls below this threshold, ILAB then examines 
2
the governmental, private sector, and civil society systems in place to assist victims and prevent recurrence of the 
problem. ILAB seeks to confirm that any isolated cases of child or forced labor found in the sector are addressed 
timely, through appropriate protections and services.

3
        In examining all evidence related to a removal, ILAB seeks corroboration from multiple sources. ILAB confirms that 

its sources are not tainted by bias or corruption, and that independent parties confirm its findings.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRSThe study focused on the three different ways in which 
sugarcane is produced in Panama: directly by the formal 
sugarcane companies, by independent producers known as 
colonos, and through traditional, family-based production. In 
the case of sugarcane directly cultivated and harvested by the 
sugarcane companies, no child labor was found. In the colonos 
and family farms, cases of child labor were found, but were few 
in number.

USDOL’s research also confirmed that the Government of 
Panama, sugar producers, and civil society have all played an 
active role in reducing child labor in the sugarcane sector. On a 
general level, the Government of Panama regularly collects and 
publishes national child labor data, and carries out awareness 
raising campaigns on child labor. In 2016, the government 
updated its list of hazardous occupations for children, and 
institutionalized a national training agenda for child labor 
inspectors.19 In 2017, it made modifications to the Labor Code 
that strengthened and clarified the penalties for child labor, 
and launched a child labor monitoring information system to 
strengthen interagency coordination on child labor cases. Also 
in 2017, labor inspectors received training on agricultural 
labor inspections and occupational safety and health.20 

Specific to the sugarcane industry, Panama’s Labor 
Inspectorate carries out labor inspection of sugar mills, liquor 
producers, and some colonos.21 Civil society organizations in 
Panama confirmed that in recent years the government had 
intensified efforts to eradicate child labor, with a particular 
emphasis on child labor in agriculture and sugarcane, 
including unannounced labor inspections of sugarcane 
producers. The Government of Panama also collaborates with 
civil society groups to provide services to children in child 
labor and their families, and those at risk. These include direct 
removal of children from exploitative situations, provision 
of food and school scholarships, support for sports activities, 
training for teachers, and conditional cash transfers. The 
government also collaborates with USDOL-funded projects 
working to eradicate child labor in Panama, including Partners 
of the Americas’ EducaFuturo project and the ILO’s Building 
Effective Policies Against Child Labor and MAP16 projects.

Sugar mills and liquor companies have policies in place 
prohibiting families from bringing their children to the fields 
and children from participating in the harvest. They check 
identity documents of all workers and conduct surprise 
inspections of the colonos from which they source sugarcane 
to ensure that children are not working. A civil society 
representative corroborated that companies enforce a zero 
tolerance child labor policy, noting that colonos who used 
children would be fined and lose access to credit.

Sugar mills and liquor producers provide transportation for 
the workers to the farms, and the drivers are forbidden to take 

minors to work areas. Security personnel do not allow minors 
onto the property unless they are visitors and accompanied 
by a responsible adult. Workers must show their badges to 
enter, and managers refuse to issue badges to minors and 
check identity documents to verify age before issuing badges 
to adults. Sugar mills and liquor producers also collaborate 
with civil society groups. Companies support organizations, 
like Casa Esperanza, that provide services to children. Some 
companies have centers on-site with teachers that care for 
the children of cane-cutters and provide them meals and 
transportation. 

Based on this information and evidence, USDOL has 
concluded that child labor in Panama’s sugarcane sector has 
been significantly reduced to isolated incidents. In addition, 
if a case of child labor were to be found in the sector, 
mechanisms are in place to remedy the situation, although 
these mechanisms should continue to be strengthened. 

Child Labor in Cotton 
Production in Paraguay

In 2018, USDOL determined that the incidence of child labor 
in the production of cotton in Paraguay has been significantly 
reduced, and available evidence supports the removal of child 
labor in the production of this good from the TVPRA List. 
Historically, cotton has been an important crop in Paraguay, 
and in 2009, USDOL added child labor in the production of 
cotton in Paraguay to the TVPRA List. In 2015, USDOL began 
to receive limited reports from stakeholders that cotton was 
no longer a key crop for the country’s economy and that child 
labor in cotton was no longer a significant problem in Paraguay 
as cotton production had greatly decreased. In response to 
these reports, USDOL carried out research to understand the 
current labor conditions in cotton and analyze the factors that 
may have affected any changes in the sector.

In addition, in 2016, the Government of Paraguay published 
the results of the Survey of Activities of Rural Area Children 
and Adolescents (EANA Rural 2015) examining child labor in 
agriculture.22 The report did not include information on cotton, 
other than to indicate that the incidence of child labor in cotton 
was too low to include in the report due to insufficient cases in 
the sample. The survey covered all of the Departments where 
Paraguay’s Ministry of Agriculture data indicates cotton is 
produced in Paraguay. 

USDOL’s research found that the reduction of cotton production 
had also resulted in a reduction of child labor in the sector. 
Available evidence from Paraguay indicates the prevalence of 
child labor in cotton correlates with the production of cotton in 
the country. These findings corroborate the results of the EANA 

29

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS2018  LIST OF GOODS PRODUCED BY CHILD LABOR OR FORCED LABORRural 2015 that did not find sufficient cases of child labor in 
cotton to include in the survey report and indicate that child 
labor in cotton in Paraguay has been reduced to an isolated 
incidence. These findings suggest that if cotton production 
were to increase in Paraguay, the prevalence of child labor may 
also increase, unless the Government of Paraguay continues 
to increase its capacity to enforce child labor laws in the 
agriculture sector. As a result, the Government of Paraguay 
should closely monitor the cotton sector to ensure that any 
increase in cotton production does not result in an increase in 
child labor. 

Child Labor in 
Cotton Production in 
Uzbekistan

In 2018, USDOL determined that the incidence of child labor in 
the production of cotton in Uzbekistan has been significantly 
reduced, and available evidence supports the removal of child 
labor in the production of this good from the TVPRA List. 

Review of Evidence of Child Labor in Cotton 
Production in 2009 and in the 2017 Harvest
USDOL placed child labor in the production of cotton from 
Uzbekistan on the List in 2009, based on 22 sources dating 
from 2002 to 2008. Sources indicated that children as young 
as age 7 were systematically mobilized by their schools for 
labor in the cotton harvest.23 

In 2009, children were reportedly subject to coercive and 
unfree recruitment practices, as schools were closed during 
the harvest and children were mobilized by their schools to 
pick cotton. Children who refused to participate in the cotton 
harvest were also reportedly punished with expulsion from 
school, being held back in school, or receiving bad grades.24 
Children’s freedom of movement was limited during the time 
of the harvest.25 Some children were reportedly forced to live 
in makeshift accommodations in schools, where they slept on 
concrete floors and were given inadequate food.26 In addition, 
children commonly either were not paid, were paid extremely 
low wages, or had wages withheld for food and housing costs 
during the harvest.27 

Since 2009, child labor in cotton picking has remained on the 
List. Although reporting indicated that the scope of the child 
labor problem had greatly decreased by 2015, there continued 

to be reports of systematic mobilization of children.28 However, 
current reports indicate that the incidence of child labor in the 
sector has been significantly reduced to isolated incidents.29

For the 2017 harvest, reporting from independent activists 
and private citizens documented only a small number of cases 
of child labor. In some of these cases, children were picking 
cotton as part of a school group, in what appeared to be 
mobilization of a class of children.30 Unlike in previous years, 
upon receiving allegations of child labor from independent 
activists, the government made efforts to investigate and 
remediate such cases.31

In addition, ILO monitoring in 2017 identified 12 children ages 
10 to 14 engaged in child labor in one field in Karakalpakstan. 
In this case, the children were immediately removed from 
the field, and the local mahalla leader, the local Ministry of 
Education representative, the district prosecutor, and the 
district hokim each participated in investigation of the issue. 
ILO monitors concluded that the case was an isolated incident. 
The Uzbek government’s Coordination Council-led monitoring 
separately identified 18 children engaged in child labor in 
the cotton harvest. The Government of Uzbekistan issued 
administrative penalties for using child labor.32 

Based on this reporting, the evidence available indicates that 
child labor in the production of cotton has been reduced to 
isolated incidents.

The Path to Removal: Multi-Stakeholder Efforts to 
Address Child Labor in Cotton Production
The removal of child labor in the production of Uzbek cotton 
from the List is a result of targeted action, the collection 
and reporting of credible information, and the investment 
of significant resources on the part of the Government of 
Uzbekistan, the ILO, Uzbek and international civil society groups, 
and the U.S. Government. Working together, these actors have 
achieved a significant reduction in the incidence of child labor in 
the sector. 

Over the past decade, the international community has 
exerted increasing pressure on the Government of Uzbekistan 
to address child labor, forced child labor, and forced labor 
of adults in the cotton harvest. USDOL’s Findings on the 
Worst Forms of Child Labor (TDA) report has reported on 
mobilizations of children for the cotton harvest since 2001. 
Since 2011, Uzbekistan had received an annual assessment 
of “No Advancement” due to government complicity in forced 
child labor. In addition, the State Department’s Trafficking in 
Persons Report downgraded Uzbekistan to Tier 3 in 2013 due 
to use of forced labor of children and adults in the harvest.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS2018  LIST OF GOODS PRODUCED BY CHILD LABOR OR FORCED LABORIn 2010, the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of 
Conventions and Recommendations and the Committee on 
the Application of Standards (CAS) began recommending that 
Uzbekistan allow the ILO to conduct monitoring of the cotton 
harvest. These calls were also echoed by the Cotton Campaign, 
a coalition of human rights and labor rights-focused NGOs, 
responsible investor organizations, and businesses that since 
2007 has advocated for an end to labor abuses in the cotton 
harvest.33

In 2013, the Government of Uzbekistan committed to 
addressing the issue of child labor in the cotton harvest and 
accepted the ILO CAS recommendation to allow ILO monitoring 
of the cotton harvest. ILO monitoring of the cotton harvest 
subsequently expanded in 2015 when it partnered with the 
World Bank to implement Third Party Monitoring (TPM) of 
the cotton harvest. In the 2015 and 2016 harvests, ILO TPM 
determined that the use of children in the cotton harvest was 
rare and sporadic, but found that 16- and 17-year-old children 
remained at risk of mobilization. Both years, despite the 
national prohibition on this practice, independent human rights 
monitors continued to report that younger children were being 
mobilized by their schools at the direction of regional and local 
government officials. 

Uzbekistan also undertook efforts to address child labor in 
the cotton harvest. For example, in 2014, the government 
signed an MOU with the ILO to implement a Decent Work 
Country Program (DWCP project) in Uzbekistan, supported by 
USDOL funding. Under the project, the government and the 
ILO conducted extensive annual awareness-raising activities 
on the prohibition of child labor and conducted research on 
recruitment and employment conditions in the cotton harvest. 
The government also established and maintained its own 
monitoring program for child and forced labor in the cotton 
harvest, for which the DWCP project provided annual trainings.

In 2017, the government established a Parliamentary 
Commission on Ensuring Guaranteed Labor Rights of Citizens, 
which monitors activities of central and local-level government 
bodies involved in preventing child labor and forced labor. The 
government has also developed and begun implementing a plan 
to modernize the agriculture sector, which includes increasing 
crop diversification, decreasing production of cotton, increasing 
the procurement price of cotton, mechanizing the cotton 
harvest, and allowing private companies that produce finished 
textile goods to vertically integrate into cotton farming.34  

The Road Ahead—Full Elimination of Child and 
Forced Labor in Cotton Production

Despite the significant reduction in the use of child labor in 
cotton production achieved through these efforts, continued 
improvement will be important to ensure that the use of adult 
forced labor is also addressed in the sector and progress 
continues toward the full elimination of child labor. The 
quota system remains intact, and continues to incentivize 
regional and local government officials to mobilize adults 
for forced labor in the harvest. Evidence indicates that more 
than 300,000 adults were forced to pick cotton in the 2017 
harvest.35 Recommendations for the sector include:

  •  Revise policies that mandate cotton harvest quotas and 

incentivize mobilization of forced labor to meet production 
targets and which may create a continued risk of 
mobilization of children and adults.

  •  Continue working with the ILO to introduce measures to 
eliminate forced labor and attract labor voluntarily for the 
cotton harvest through formalization of the recruitment 
process and improvement of employment conditions.

  •  Work to improve enforcement of labor laws in Uzbekistan, 

by ensuring that the Labor Inspectorate has adequate 
inspectors to cover the country’s workforce and that 
inspectors are permitted to conduct unannounced 
inspections in all sectors.

  •  Build public trust in the Feedback Mechanism hotlines and 
other mechanisms for receiving child labor and forced labor 
complaints, especially by ensuring individuals who make 
use of these mechanisms do not experience retaliation.
  •  Continue to coordinate with human rights activists and 
to allow independent observers unrestricted access to 
monitor labor conditions during the cotton harvest through 
unannounced site visits.

  •  Utilize the Parliamentary Commission and other 

available resources to increase coordination efforts 
directed at regional and district governments. ILO 
Monitoring and USDOL research observed a need for 
continued coordination and capacity building to ensure 
that governments at the regional and district level are 
consistently enforcing national prohibitions on forced labor 
of adults, especially teachers.

The Government of Uzbekistan has demonstrated the political 
will to work towards the elimination of forced labor. This is 
perhaps best exemplified by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s 
September 2017 speech to the UN General Assembly, in which 
he committed to addressing forced labor in Uzbekistan. USDOL 
urges the government to continue to follow through on these 
commitments. USDOL continues to support the government’s 
efforts to address issues of child labor and forced labor through 
funding for implementation of the DWCP.

32

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRSWorking Together to End Child Labor 
and Forced Labor

As the above examples from Uzbekistan, Panama, and 
many others illustrate, the elimination of child labor 
and forced labor in a specific industry and country is 
achievable when stakeholders make it a priority. At 
the global level, the international community has set a 
goal of eradicating all forms of child labor by 2025, and 
all forced labor by 2030. The United States has always 
played a leadership role in this fight. Achieving these 
goals will not be easy, and will require all stakeholders—
governments, companies and industry groups, social 
partners and civil society groups, multilateral bodies—to 
do their part. 

The United States sees the vital importance of eradicating 
these global abuses in order to level the playing field on 
which our businesses and workers compete. And while we 
put the American worker first, “America First” does not 
mean America alone. It means protecting and advancing 
our vital interests, while also fostering cooperation and 
strengthening relationships with our allies and partners.36 
The United States will continue to work with other 
governments to ensure that all countries share these 
responsibilities, and will continue to support companies and 
industry groups, workers and civil society organizations, 
and multilateral bodies to accelerate progress. The section 
below discusses significant achievements during the 
reporting period by each of these actors. 

Governments

Efforts to address child labor and forced labor worldwide 
depend, first and foremost, on government leadership and 
action. By ratifying international conventions such as ILO 
Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labor and 
Convention 29 on Forced Labor, governments commit 
themselves to upholding the international standards enshrined 
in these instruments. Yet the gap between standards and on-
the-ground realities is often wide: many countries have ratified 
international standards but do not meaningfully implement 
them, for lack of will, capacity, or resources. In November 
2017, at the IV Global Conference on the Sustained Eradication 
of Child Labor in Buenos Aires, Argentina, representatives of 
governments, social partners, and civil society gathered to 
discuss challenges and solutions on the path to achieving the 
goal of eliminating child labor and forced labor by 2030. The 
outcome was the Buenos Aires Declaration on Child Labor, 
Forced Labor, and Youth Employment (Declaration).37 Delegates 
at the conference urged the wider international community 
to commit to actions in the areas of policy and governance; 
knowledge, data, and monitoring; and partnerships and 
innovation to accelerate action to reduce child labor and 
forced labor.

The first of the three areas, policy and governance, rests 
squarely in the purview of government. The actions promoted

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS2018  LIST OF GOODS PRODUCED BY CHILD LABOR OR FORCED LABORby the Declaration include strengthening legal frameworks; 
aligning policies, strategies, and action plans; building capacity 
of enforcement bodies; and protecting vulnerable populations. 
Our current reporting period has seen several notable 
government achievements. For example, the Government of 
India strengthened its legal framework in 2016 by adopting 
the Child Labor (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment 
Act, which set the minimum age for work at 14 and raised 
the minimum age for hazardous work to 18. In 2017, the 
Government of India furthered its commitment to combating 
child labor by ratifying ILO Convention 138 on the minimum 
age for work and ILO Convention 182 on the worst forms of 
child labor. In the area of policy and governance, as noted 
above, the Government of Uzbekistan took concerted policy 
action over a period of many years to achieve near-elimination 
of child labor in the production of cotton. 

The Declaration’s second area of action is knowledge, data, 
and monitoring; it calls for data collection and dissemination 
on child labor and forced labor. A key tool for governments 
in this area is the nationally- or sectorally-representative 
survey. As noted above, the additions to the 2018 List include 
a large number of goods being added based on survey data. 
Paraguay, Brazil, and El Salvador all conducted nationally-
representative child labor prevalence surveys in recent years, 
and Eswatini conducted a representative survey on child 
labor in herding. The collection and dissemination of child 
labor data demonstrates these countries’ commitment to 
addressing child labor and recognition of the importance of 
data to the design and implementation of sound policies and 
programs. In some cases, countries such as Paraguay, Brazil, 
and Vietnam have a number of goods on the List, in part, 
because those governments demonstrated their commitment 
to the prevention and reduction of child labor by carrying out 
rigorous survey efforts and publishing the data. It does not 
mean these countries have a larger problem of child labor than 
other countries. Rather, it shows that they are leaders in the 
global effort to address these issues. 

Brazil’s Leadership on Forced Labor Eradication 
There is perhaps no better example of efforts to address 
forced labor than those of the Government of Brazil. The 
government has incorporated forced labor questions into its 
national household survey and implemented a forced labor 
survey in the state of Maranhão. Its Labor Prosecutor’s Office 
has developed an online tool called SmartLab to identify risks 
associated with forced labor, as well as an online platform 
for social partners and civil society to submit forced labor 
complaints. During the past six years, ILAB has supported the 
Government of Brazil’s efforts through a $6.8 million technical 
assistance project. The project has worked with government to 
assist persons vulnerable to forced labor in the states of Bahia 
and Mato Grosso. It has also sought to build off these efforts by 

“Countries such as Paraguay,

establishing an exchange program between the Government 
of Brazil and the Government of Peru to develop pilot tools to 
investigate forced labor cases, conduct joint inspections, and 
strengthen the role of the judicial system. 

Paraguay’s Leadership on Labor Law Enforcement 
The Government of Paraguay’s efforts to address child labor 
did not begin with the recent survey. The Government of 
Paraguay has partnered with ILAB to address child labor 
since 2000. Most notably, after the Government of Paraguay 
established the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social 
Security (MTESS) in 2014, MTESS and ILAB collaborated 
to help build the capacity of the new ministry and tackle 
important challenges, including combating child labor and 
strengthening enforcement of its labor laws. Poverty, social 
exclusion, and limited education, training, and livelihood 
opportunities created vulnerabilities to child labor exploitation. 
In Paraguay, almost a quarter of the population lives below 
the poverty line, and in rural areas, agricultural workers often 
receive the lowest wages. Enforcing labor laws in agriculture, 

34

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRSsuch as the minimum wage, is particularly challenging, but 
low wages contribute to families struggling to feed themselves, 
many times propelling children to work in the fields to help 
sustain the household. 

Building on previous efforts, in 2015, ILAB awarded $6 million 
to Partners of the Americas to implement the project Paraguay 
Okakuaa, which means “Paraguay Progresses” in the Guaraní 
language. Led by the MTESS, Paraguay Okakuaa has been 
working to reduce child labor, improve working conditions, 
and strengthen the enforcement of labor laws in agriculture 
in the Department of Guairá. The project has been working 
closely with the MTESS to help strengthen the effectiveness 
of the Labor Inspectorate by establishing a specialized 
training program for a new cadre of highly qualified labor 
inspectors and piloting a new system to track cases of labor 
law violations. To complement these efforts, USDOL’s Wage 
and Hour Division (WHD) and Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) have also provided technical advice to 
the MTESS Labor Inspectorate on techniques and procedures 
for agricultural inspections. 

Additionally, in response to the Government of Paraguay’s 
desire to prevent forced labor in the Chaco region, in 
2017, Paraguay Okakuaa expanded efforts to the Chaco, a 
significant cattle- and beef-exporting area. As part of MTESS’s 
commitment to increase protection of vulnerable workers 
and families in that area, MTESS established a new regional 
office in the city of Filadelfia to respond to workers’ complaints 
and conduct compliance outreach to employers. In March 
2018, the Minister of Labor, the Governor of the Department 

of Boquerón, other national and local authorities, business 
representatives, and indigenous and other community leaders 
participated in the opening event for the new MTESS office and 
presentation of Paraguay Okakuaa in the Chaco. These events 
emphasized MTESS’ presence in the Chaco, a vast and isolated 
area, and an awareness campaign developed by MTESS and 
Paraguay Okakuaa will further amplify MTESS’ existence. 

Companies and Industry 
Groups

Private sector leadership is critical in the global fight against 
child labor and forced labor. Not only do these abuses cause 
serious and long-lasting harm to victims, they also present 
serious and material risks to companies and industries.

A growing body of law in countries around the world is shifting 
private sector action on these issues from a purely voluntary 
endeavor toward a mandatory one.38 Some jurisdictions require 
companies to take specific measures, such as ensuring that 
no misleading or fraudulent practices are used in the process 
of recruiting workers, or ensuring that workers’ identity 
or immigration documents are not destroyed, concealed, 
confiscated, or otherwise denied to workers. Other jurisdictions 
require various forms of transparency, such as disclosure of 
supply chain partners, or disclosure of the measures a company 
has taken to combat forced labor. These requirements are 
fragmented, however, and by and large, private sector action to 
combat these abuses remains a voluntary undertaking.

Learning from Nestlé and its Supply Chain Partners
Agriculture is everywhere. Beyond just food and drink, agricultural goods like rubber, bamboo, and flowers are vital to 
a broad set of industries. Given that agriculture accounts for a high proportion of child labor and forced labor globally, 
more and more companies that use agricultural inputs are facing these risks. The U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) Guidelines for Eliminating Child and Forced Labor in Agricultural Supply Chains is a tool developed by the U.S. 
Departments of Labor, State, and Agriculture, along with representatives of business and civil society, to address these 
risks. The Guidelines outline specific elements that should be integrated into any agricultural company program to reduce 
child or forced labor, such as mapping supply chains and conducting risk assessments; designing communication and 
monitoring mechanisms; and developing plans and programs for remediating violations. 

From 2015-2018, ILAB collaborated with the Fair Labor Association, multinational company Nestlé, and two of Nestlé’s 
suppliers, Balsu and Olam-Progida, to pilot-test the Guidelines in the Turkish hazelnut supply chain. This project was a 
key opportunity to demonstrate the application of the Guidelines in practice, and to learn lessons that can be applied in 
other agricultural contexts. The partners’ challenges, successes, and learnings along the way are documented in a new 
report from the Fair Labor Association, Harvesting the Future: Piloting the U.S. Department of Agriculture Guidelines for 
Eliminating Child Labor and Forced Labor in Turkey’s Hazelnut Harvest.43 Ultimately, ILAB hopes that this report will help 
other companies to replicate and adapt this important tool, the Guidelines, to various locations and commodities.

to strengthen their existing systems. The app contains many 
examples of specific good practices that companies, industry 
groups, and multi-stakeholder initiatives have put in place in 
these eight areas. In September 2018, ILAB is releasing French 
and Spanish versions of this app to increase its utility for a 
wider audience, including small and medium-sized enterprises.

As we engage with private sector actors to encourage them to 
adopt these practices, we also continue to learn about new 
practices that industry leaders are implementing. Electronics 
companies are leading the way on bonded labor, ensuring that 
millions of dollars in recruitment fees are reimbursed to workers 
who found themselves in debt bondage.40 Agricultural companies 
are hiring social workers to provide services to families and 
children in sourcing communities and to remediate child labor 
and forced labor where found (see Box 7).41 Financial services 
companies are using technology to identify cash flows related to 
trafficking in persons, and screening clients based on labor and 
human rights criteria.42 And innovators across various industries 
are developing new technologies to help them combat these 
abuses (see Box 8).

Corporate Efforts on the Rise
Companies looking to collaborate with peers to address child 
labor and forced labor have no shortage of options. Forward-
leaning companies have joined the Institute for Human Rights 
and Business’s Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment, 
a collaboration seeking to drive positive change in the 
way that migrant workers are recruited.44 The Responsible 
Business Alliance is consulting with workers in Malaysia and 
the region to develop solutions to transform the market for 
ethical business practices, including foreign migrant worker 
recruitment.45 Over 250 apparel and textile companies have 
signed the Responsible Sourcing Network’s Cotton Pledge 
Against Forced Labor, committing to end the practice of forced 
labor in the cotton sector in Uzbekistan.46 The Consumer Goods 
Forum’s membership of over 400 retailers and manufacturers 
have all endorsed Priority Industry Principles on forced labor

Technology and Modern Slavery
It is ultimately up to human beings to acknowledge 
and solve the problems of child labor and forced 
labor. But technology can help, and the international 
community is increasingly availing itself of an 
ever-more sophisticated tool set. A plethora of 
technologies have been developed or applied 
to addressing specific challenges. For example, 
tracking technologies can help governments and/
or service providers to identify where exploited 
workers are located; these technologies can also 
trace the paths of goods through often complex 
supply chains to hold exploiters accountable 
at every step. Many workers have access to an 
increasing number of mobile applications that 
enable them to share information about employers 
and recruiters with each other or about exploitative 
practices with supply chain actors who may be able 
to provide remedy. Some employers are leveraging 
electronic and “smart” payment systems to ensure 
that workers are able to receive and keep their 
wages safe. And we’ve only hit the tip of the iceberg: 
new methods are constantly being developed to 
share data among those who can use it to solve 
problems and analyze patterns in data in order to 
respond more effectively.

Comply Chain: ILAB’s Tool for the 
Private Sector
ILAB’s mobile application Comply Chain: 
Business Tools for Labor Compliance in 
Global Supply Chains is a resource for 

companies and industry groups seeking to develop voluntary 
social compliance systems to mitigate child labor and forced 
labor risks in their global production. The Comply Chain app 
responds to the TVPRA of 2005 mandate that ILAB “work 
with persons who are involved in the production of goods 
on [the TVPRA List] to create a standard set of practices that 
will reduce the likelihood that such persons will produce 
goods using [forced or child labor].”39 Comply Chain provides 
practical, step-by-step guidance on eight critical elements of 
social compliance, and is designed for companies that do not

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS(see Box 9). In June 2018, the ILO launched a Global Business 
Network Against Forced Labor and Human Trafficking as a 
forum for peer learning and collective problem-solving. Based 
on stakeholder input, the Network plans to focus on assisting 
companies to address issues at lower tiers of supply chains, 
working with Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) on 
social compliance, and catalyzing business to play an active 
role in legal and policy advocacy. The ILO continues to welcome 
additional companies to join the Network.

Civil Society

Civil society organizations play a vital role in the fight against 
child labor and forced labor. Some focus directly on research 
or policy advocacy on these issues, or service provision 
to victims, while others work to promote the fundamental 
principles and rights at work and basic social protections that 
must underlie the sustainable eradication of these problems. 
Workers and workers’ organizations, community-based 
organizations and other non-governmental organizations all 
play a part.

ILAB supports numerous civil society organizations through 
technical assistance funding, to promote labor law enforcement 
and help end child labor and forced labor in trade partner 
countries. In 2017, ILAB funded projects to build the capacity 
of civil society to address these issues and promote acceptable 
conditions of work in the supply chains of several goods on 
the TVPRA List. These projects are now being implemented 

in Colombia’s coffee and mining industries, Bangladesh’s 
dried fish and garment industries, and Vietnam’s garment 
sector. Since 2015, ILAB has also supported the ILO to work 
with the International Trade Union Confederation to form 
and strengthen a forced labor focal point network of unions 
to provide support to national efforts against forced labor 
in Malaysia, Paraguay, and Niger. This has included such 
activities as trainings on worker rights in Paraguay and 
awareness-raising events among workers in other countries.47 
Through the partnerships we have developed with these 
organizations, ILAB has helped create an incubator for positive 
social change.

ILAB also produces tools to assist civil society in developing 
good practices. The Reducing Incidence of Child Labor and 
Harmful Conditions of Work in Economic Strengthening 
Initiatives (RICHES) project aims to integrate the issues of 
child labor alleviation and acceptable conditions of work into 
women’s economic empowerment initiatives. The project, 
implemented by the Grameen Foundation, will develop 
and deploy tools to better equip policymakers and service 
providers to educate women entrepreneurs to comply with 
laws protecting children and promoting acceptable conditions 
of work. The tools will be tested in two strategic locations, El 
Salvador and the Philippines. Once tested, the tools will be 
available for broader distribution and global application.

Consumers are also important users of the TVPRA List. Box 10 
provides an example of one way in which the List reaches 
consumers.

The List of Goods in Your Grocery Store 
HowGood is a social and environmental impact ratings company that has built the largest food sustainability 
database in the world. The company uses these data to evaluate impacts across three benchmarks: Growing 
Guidelines, Processing Practices, and Company Conduct. These benchmarks include 12 standards and more than 
70 specific indicators, summarized into a simple rating scheme for food products on the market. The ratings are 
communicated directly to consumers at point of purchase in grocery stores (like Giant Foods and Ahold-Delhaize) 
and online, and have been proven to shift purchasing behavior towards more sustainable products.

HowGood’s evaluations consider the impacts associated with each specific ingredient used in a product. Many 
globally-sourced agricultural commodities (such as cocoa, tea, coffee, palm oil, and sugar) include significant risks 
of child and forced labor in their supply systems. During the research process for each commodity, HowGood 
refers to the List of Goods as an authoritative source of information on labor risks. Products containing 
ingredients from commodities included on the List can 
receive lower ratings in the HowGood system unless a 
company can show definitive and third-party-verified 
mitigation of the potential labor risk. As a result, 
millions of US consumers in 26 states are indirectly 
using the TVPRA List to minimize the risk that their 
purchases inadvertently support exploitative labor 
practices around the world.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS2018  LIST OF GOODS PRODUCED BY CHILD LABOR OR FORCED LABORMultilateral Bodies

ILAB also engages in multilateral fora, such as the ILO, 
OECD, G20, and G7, to develop strategies to improve working 
conditions and respect for labor rights in global supply 
chains. For example, in June 2018, the International Labor 
Conference’s Committee on the Application of Standards 
discussed and provided recommendations on a child labor 
case involving Bolivia, and forced labor cases involving 
Eritrea, Cambodia, and Belarus.48

In May 2017, the G20 Labor and Employment Ministers 
committed to taking immediate and effective measures 
to eradicate modern slavery, forced labor, and human 
trafficking, and by 2025, end child labor in all its forms.49 
This commitment was reaffirmed by the G20 Leaders in July 
2017.50 In February 2018, in response to a request from 
G20 Labor and Employment Ministers, the ILO recommended 
concrete actions for G20 countries to undertake to achieve 
the goals of eradicating child labor, forced labor, human 
trafficking, and modern slavery, with an emphasis on global 
supply chains.51 Based on these recommendations, ILAB is 
exploring opportunities for further G20 action on this critical 
issue by building on the commitments made at the IV Global 
Conference.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) and Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (OSCE) play important roles in educating member 
states and private sector actors about child labor, forced labor, 
and related issues; addressing specific cases of alleged labor 
rights violations; and providing guidance to address these 
problems. In 2017, the OECD launched much-anticipated 
Garment and Footwear Due Diligence Guidance,52 following 
that in 2018 with its General Due Diligence Guidance for 
Responsible Business Conduct.53 Both are designed to align 
with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and 
the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Also 
in 2018, the OECD released Model Guidelines on Government 
Measures to Prevent Trafficking for Labour Exploitation in 
Supply Chains54 and a Compendium of relevant reference 
materials and resources on ethical sourcing and prevention 
of trafficking in human beings for labor exploitation in supply 
chains.55 The Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking 
in Persons and Related Transnational Crime’s Working 
Group on Trafficking in Persons promotes more effective and 
coordinated law and justice responses to combat trafficking 
in persons in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2017, the Bali Process 
expanded their work to establish the Government and Business 
Forum to bring together high-level officials from member 
countries and senior private sector actors to combat the worst 
forms of child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking in the 

“Common operational definitions 
and data collection strategies 
on forced labour will allow 
the international community 
working on forced labour 
issues to have high-quality 
internationally comparable 
forced labour statistics, as well 
as comparability across time 
within countries, allowing 
better-informed policymaking 
on the issue.”

Principles and Rights at Work Branch, International Labor 
Organization

region.56 Finally, the International Organization for Migration 
(IOM) published Remediation Guidelines for Victims of Human 
Trafficking in Mineral Supply Chains to help companies 
ensure that victims of exploitation have access to remediation 
wherever they have been harmed by exploitative business 
practices.57 

A lesser-known, yet vital multilateral contribution to the fight 
against forced labor is the International Conference of Labor 
Statisticians (ICLS), the world’s recognized standard-setting 
body in the area of labor statistics. Convened by the ILO every 
five years, ICLS issues resolutions and guidelines on selected 
topics of labor statistics, which are then approved by the ILO’s 
Governing Body. The 20th ICLS will meet in October 2018 
to discuss guidelines on the measurement of forced labor. 
These guidelines have been developed after 6 preparatory 
technical meetings and one working group meeting with 
experts from national statistical offices, employers’ and 
workers’ organizations, and discussions with international 
organizations, academia, and research centers to agree on 
concepts and standardize the statistical measurement of forced 
labor.58

The U.S. Experience

The TVPRA mandates that ILAB research the production of 
goods “in foreign countries.” As a result, the List does not 
cover domestically-produced goods. However, child labor and 
forced labor are problems that all countries share, including 
the United States. The Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour 
Division enforces the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which 
prohibits oppressive child labor and, in the course of its 
civil law enforcement investigations, may detect instances 
of forced labor. For example, in 2017, the U.S. Department 
of Labor finalized a series of settlements with four Chinese 
construction firms on Saipan in the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands. The firms were required to pay 
nearly $14 million in back wages and damages for Fair Labor 
Standards Act violations to thousands of employees who came 
from China to build the Saipan Casino and Hotel on the island.59 

USDOL investigators found that the firms had confiscated the 
workers’ passports upon arrival in Saipan, paid employees 
below minimum wage, and required them to work 13 hours a 
day without weekends or holidays. Many of the employees had 
arrived in Saipan already indebted by thousands of dollars for 
airfare and recruitment fees.60 

In 2018, a Texas couple was prosecuted for the enslavement 
of a Nigerian nanny. Throughout the two-year-period when 
the victim worked for the couple, her passport and visa were 
confiscated, her wages withheld and her movement restricted 
to the couple’s residence or short walks around the block. The 
couple also verbally and psychologically abused the victim. 
Following a tip-off to the National Human Trafficking Resource 
Center, the case was investigated by members of the Human 
Trafficking Rescue Alliance, which included representatives 
of the Department of Homeland Security/Immigration and 

39

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS2018  LIST OF GOODS PRODUCED BY CHILD LABOR OR FORCED LABORCustoms Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations, 
the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division, the Fort 
Bend County Sheriff’s Office, and the Department of State’s 
Diplomatic Security Service. The victim was awarded more 
than $100,000 in restitution.61 

USDOL’s Wage and Hour Division also enforces the labor 
provisions of the H-2A agricultural worker visa program. 
In a recent example, a farm owner was debarred from the 
program for three years and assessed a $35,755 civil penalty 
for violating the labor provisions of the H-2A program, and was 
found to owe $58,820 in back wages to 14 employees.62 The 
farm owner had failed to reimburse foreign workers for their 
transportation expenses to and from their home countries as 
the law requires, failed to reimburse employees for expenses 
related to obtaining their visas, failed to keep required time 
and pay records, and failed to pay employees their wages when 
due. 

Additional examples of U.S. Government efforts to address 
forced labor within our borders can be found in the U.S. 
Department of State’s 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report—
Country Narrative on the United States; the Attorney General’s 
Annual Report to Congress and Assessment of U.S. Government 
Activities to Combat Trafficking in Persons; and in a report 
required by the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015.63 
To learn more on the laws about child labor in the United 
States, as well as the U.S. Government’s efforts to implement 
them, see The Department of Labor’s 2017 Findings on the 
Worst Forms of Child Labor.64 
Preventing the Importation of Goods Made by 
Forced Labor
While the TVPRA List does not cover domestically-produced goods, 
the TVPRA requires that ILAB “consult with other departments 
and agencies of the U.S. Government to reduce forced and child 
labor internationally and to ensure that products made by forced 
labor and child labor in violation of international standards are not 
imported in the United States.” The U.S. Government has passed 
legislation in recent years that relates directly to this mandate and 
seeks to better address the use of forced labor in the production 
and importation of goods.

The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act (TFTEA) 
was enacted in 2016.65 The law included an amendment to 
the Tariff Act of 1930 removing the “consumptive demand” 
exemption to the Tariff Act’s prohibition on the importation of 
goods into the United States produced by forced, convict, forced 
child, or indentured labor.66 Previously, the exemption had 
allowed for goods made by such labor into the United States, 
if the goods were not produced domestically in sufficient 
quantities to meet U.S. consumer demand.

Since the passage of TFTEA, there has been an increase in 
enforcement by the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Tariff Act. For 
example, in March of 2018, CBP issued a Withhold Release 
Order (WRO) for toys made by forced labor from China.67 Toys 
from China are on the List for both forced labor and child labor. 
In addition, in May of 2018, CBP issued a WRO for all cotton 
from Turkmenistan or products made in whole or in part with 
Turkmen cotton.68 Turkmen cotton is also on the List for both 
forced labor and child labor. 

The U.S. Government’s efforts to prevent forced labor in goods 
produced overseas does not stop there. On August 2, 2017, the 
President signed into law the Countering America’s Adversaries 
Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).69 CAATSA, which amended 
the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016, 
creates a rebuttable presumption that goods produced wholly or in 
part by North Korean nationals or North Korean citizens anywhere 
in the world are forced labor goods prohibited from importation 
into the U.S. under the Tariff Act, unless the CBP finds by clear and 
convincing evidence that the goods were not produced using a 
prohibited form of labor.70 In 2017, CBP seized 10,000 cartons of 
frozen squid produced by North Korean workers, valued at more 
than $200,000.71 

Collaboration Across 
Sectors

As noted above, the Buenos Aires Declaration’s third area of 
action is partnerships and innovation. No stakeholder can, or 
should be expected to, tackle these issues in isolation. The most 
successful achievements of the global community have come 
when actors worked together across dividing lines toward 
common interests. 

Cross-sectoral Efforts to Address Child Labor in 
Chocolate and Cocoa Production 
The majority of the world’s cocoa comes from Côte d’Ivoire and 
Ghana. Research also indicates more than 2 million children72 
are engaged in the worst forms of child labor in the production 
of cocoa from these two countries. In recent years, we have 
seen increasing momentum from governments, the private 
sector, and civil society to address the issue. There continues to 
be a strong public-private partnership, through the Child Labor 
Cocoa Coordinating Group,73 that includes the international 
chocolate and cocoa industry and the governments of Côte 
d’Ivoire and Ghana. The governments of Côte d’Ivoire and 
Ghana are at the forefront of this effort and are taking 
important steps forward through their respective National 
Plans of Action on child labor. 

40

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRSIn recent years, a number of governments and companies have 
taken steps to sustainably source cocoa.74 The governments 
of the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland have each 
worked with their respective cocoa industries to set targets 
on sustainable sourcing of cocoa. We have also seen a 
number of companies make pledges to sustainably source 
100 percent of the cocoa in their supply chains, including 
Mars Incorporated,75 Olam,76 and The Hershey Company77 
by 2020; Barry Callebaut78 and Ferrero79 by 2025; and 
Cargill80 by 2030. Other companies, including Blommer,81 
Mondelēz International,82 and Nestlé83 have also made their 
own commitments regarding the sustainable sourcing of 
cocoa within in their supply chains. In addition, companies 
are working with the International Cocoa Initiative, an 
organization promoting child protection in cocoa-growing 
communities, to pilot-test child labor monitoring and 
remediation systems as a potential model for identifying and 
addressing child labor in cocoa supply chains. Ensuring there is 
transparency and accountability within the cocoa supply chain 
is an important step toward addressing the issue. 

Civil society also continues to play a crucial role. For example, 
the Voice Network,84 an association of NGOs and trade unions 
working on sustainability in cocoa, regularly publishes the 
Cocoa Barometer,85 which serves as a valuable source of 
information on the issue. In addition, the U.S.-based Child Labor 
Coalition86 continues to serve as an important voice for civil 
society organizations committed to the elimination of the worst 
forms of child labor around the world, including in the cocoa 
sector of West Africa. More recently, the Japanese organization 
Action against Child Exploitation (ACE)87 is playing a leading 
role in raising awareness in Japan about efforts to address the 
child labor in cocoa supply chains. 

Boxes 11 and 12 illustrate other examples of cross-sectoral 
collaboration in the Southeast Asian fishing industry and in 
Panamanian agricultural supply chains. In these and many 
other industries, stakeholders are taking positive steps forward 
to address child labor and forced labor. However, it is important 
to recognize that many challenges remain. Actions taken in 
recent years need to contribute to a building of momentum in a 
way that is sustainable for the long-term.

ILAB’s Efforts to Address Abuses in the Fishing Sector
Workers at sea are among the world’s most vulnerable. The geography of the ocean, gaps in applicable laws, and other factors often 
combine to leave workers without adequate labor protections. In the mid-2010’s, investigative journalists began shedding more 
light on forced labor abuses in the fisheries industry. They detailed fishers, many of them migrants, being coerced or tricked into 
working on vessels by brokers who promise jobs in other sectors, held in forced labor for up to 10 years, forced to fish for 20 to 22 
hours a day with little or no pay, and subjected to threats and severe physical abuse. 

ILAB added seven seafood-related goods to the initial TVPRA list published in 2009, including both Thai and Burmese shrimp 
produced by forced labor. Additionally, ILAB has been funding civil society organizations to combat labor abuses in the sector in 
numerous countries for almost twenty years, including in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, Honduras, Haiti, Indonesia, Philippines, 
and Thailand. Beginning in 1999, the Project to Combat Child Labor in the Fishing Sector in Indonesia and the Philippines worked to 
combat hazardous child labor on fishing platforms (jermals) off North Sumatra in Indonesia and bubble fishing (pa-aling) and night 
fishing in Cebu and Palawan in the Philippines. The project withdrew and prevented 1,234 children from hazardous work in fishing and 
developed monitoring teams with the Department of Labor and Employment, Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, and the ILO. 
In 2010, ILAB funded a project to combat the worst forms of child labor in shrimp and seafood-processing areas in Thailand. The Royal 
Thai government continues to implement several pilot initiatives developed by this project, such as the Good Labor Practices (GLP) 
program, which is a comprehensive fisheries industry improvement program that combines establishment of industry labor guidelines 
with a training program.

As a result of efforts by ILAB and many others, more governments now have a greater understanding of the issue and are beginning 
to act. They are extending protections to migrant fishers working on their vessels and instituting joint inspections so that labor issues 
can be checked even when Labor Ministries do not have a mandate to inspect vessels. Civil society groups and the private sector 
are creating tools to help the sector combat labor abuses, several of which incorporate the TVPRA List into their methodology or 
resource lists. For example, the ResponsibleSourcingTool.org is a suite of tools that provide guidance to companies on how to develop 
compliance plans to address and prevent human trafficking in their supply chains. Its Seafood Compliance Tool 4: Risk Assessment 
Guidance for the Seafood Supply Chain draws on the TVPRA List as its source of documented incidences of forced labor in the 
industry. The Seafood Slavery Risk Tool, which rates the likelihood that forced labor, human trafficking, or hazardous child labor is 
occurring within a fishery, and the Labor Safe Screen, which helps clients trace seafood supply chains and focus resources on the 
riskiest fisheries, also use the TVPRA List as a key source of data.

BOX 12
Bringing Stakeholders 
Together to Reduce 
Child Labor in 
Panamanian Agriculture
Since first bringing the issue of child labor 
in Panamanian agricultural production to 
light via the TVPRA List, ILAB has funded 
two complementary projects to address 
child labor in Panama’s coffee industry. The 
first project, EducaFuturo, implemented 
by Partners of the Americas (Partners) 
and the International Initiative to End 
Child Labor (IIECL), began by conducting 
a study to identify risk factors for child 
labor in coffee, banana, and plantain 
production. The study looked at both 
internal operations within the companies, 
and external factors in the companies’ 
operating environment. Working with 
over 30 producers, Partners and IIECL 
developed a Model Code of Conduct on 
child labor for the coffee, banana and 
plantain sectors, engaging producers 
from the Chiriquí, Vulcan and Changuinola 
regions. EducaFuturo and partners are 
providing training and technical assistance 
to coffee, banana, and plantain producers 
to adopt the code and create plans of 
action to achieve compliance.

In 2018, the Country Level Engagement and 
Assistance to Reduce Child Labor (CLEAR 
II) project, implemented by Winrock 
International and its partner Verité, began 
work in Panama, providing assistance to 
the government to strengthen systems for 
the reduction of child labor. This project 
worked with EducaFuturo to build on 
the adoption and implementation of the 
Model Code of Conduct. Drawing on the 
implementers’ collective experience in 
working with the coffee, banana, and other 
agricultural industries around the world, 
the CLEAR II project proposed changes 
to make the Model Code more focused on 
preventing and reducing the risks of child 
labor within producers’ operations. The 
next-generation Model Code of Conduct 
was discussed at a series of workshops 
in mid-2018, involving producers, key 
stakeholders, and collaborating partners. 
CLEAR II plans to develop and deliver 
training to the Panamanian government’s 
Labor Inspectorate on how the code 
may be used as a resource to support 
their mandate to address systemic child 
labor issues in the coffee sector. CLEAR 
II and EducaFuturo are working together 
to promote the implementation of the 
Code and action plans within the coffee 
sector, and to bolster collaboration 
between inspectors and the companies 
implementing the Code and action plans in 
pursuit of their common goals.

2018  LIST OF GOODS PRODUCED BY CHILD LABOR OR FORCED LABORA Call to Action

The IV Global Conference on the Sustained Eradication 
of Child Labor imparted a new sense of urgency to the 
cause of addressing child labor and forced labor around 
the world. The delegates recognized the tremendous 
progress that has been made over the past two decades, 
a decline in child labor by 94 million children. However, 
despite the growth we have seen in information and 
awareness, laws and policies, and successful models for 
eradicating child labor, the initial goal of eliminating the 
worst forms of child labor by 2016 was not reached. 
As reflected in the ILO’s 2017 Global Estimates, the 
pace of decline in child labor has slowed in recent 
years, and the number of people in forced labor has 
remained high. It is estimated that, at the present pace 

of progress, it would take nearly 40 years to eliminate 
all forms of child labor.88

Yet we remain hopeful. The examples in this report—
meaningful and impactful actions being taken by 
governments, companies, and civil society groups—
are just the tip of the iceberg. Where there once was 
ignorance, there is knowledge. Where there was once 
denial, there is ownership. Where there was avoidance, 
there is increasing accountability resulting in action. 
We are all part of a growing community seeking, and 
finding, solutions. The 2018 List of Goods, the Comply 
Chain application, and ILAB’s other reports, including our 
annual Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor report 
and the Sweat & Toil app, form part of the constellation of 
tools needed to make progress toward the global goal of 
eradicating child labor and forced labor.

Burma – Garments – Child Labor
There are reports that children ages 12 to 17, mainly girls, produce garments in Burma. According to international 
organizations and NGOs, child labor in the garment industry is concentrated in Yangon State. For example, research has found 
at least eight garment factories in Yangon State with incidents of child labor, and reports indicate that child labor remains 
present in the industry. Though the government has placed legal restrictions on working hours and types of work for children 
under age 18, there are reports that children work the same hours as adults with higher risks of abuse. There are reports of

and boxes and work long hours, sometimes up to 15-16 hours per day or 60 hours per week, and late into the night. Factories 
are often poorly ventilated, with temperatures, at times, rising above 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

Egypt – Bricks – Child Labor
There are reports that children ages 9 to 17 produce bricks in Egypt. The country’s brick factories are located in or near the 
cities of Cairo, Giza, Helwan, and in Qalyobia governorate. One news article estimated that hundreds of children worked in 
brickmaking; another estimated that there were more than 10,000. Children work generally 8 to 13 hours per day, according 
to several news sources. Their work activities are reported to include moving sand and mud into brick-making machines, 
moving bricks into ovens, and loading baked bricks onto trucks. Brickmaking typically involves exposure to extreme 
temperatures at different stages of production, due to both the hot sun and working close to ovens set to temperatures 
reaching nearly 1,000 degrees Celsius. This work is often done without protective gear, helmets, or gloves.

El Salvador – Baked Goods – Child Labor
There is evidence that children ages 5 to 17 are engaged in the production of baked goods in El Salvador. According to 
the Government of El Salvador’s Multi-Purpose Household Survey of 2015, a working child is considered to be engaged 
in hazardous child labor if the child is performing work that is hazardous according to national legislation. The survey 
estimates that 123,259 children ages 5 to 17 perform hazardous child labor in El Salvador, including using dangerous tools, 
carrying heavy loads, working with chemicals, working long or night shifts, and being exposed to dust, smoke, or extreme 
heat or humidity. Approximately 9,737 of these children in hazardous child labor are engaged in the production of baked 
goods. The release of this survey demonstrates the Government of El Salvador’s commitment to addressing child labor 
and its acknowledgment that data collection is vital to the design and implementation of sound policies and programs.

Eswatini – Bovines – Child Labor
There is evidence that children ages 8 to 17 raise bovines in Eswatini. Child labor in this sector is concentrated in the rural 
areas of Hhohho, Lubombo, Manzini, and Shiselweni. In 2018, the Government of Eswatini and the International Labor 
Organization published results from the 2014 Survey on Child Labor in Herding in Rural Areas in Eswatini. According to 
international standards on the minimum age for work, children working below the age of 15 are engaged in child labor. The 
survey estimates that 72,332 children below the age of 15 raise bovines. Children perform physically arduous tasks while 
herding in the grasslands and mountainous regions, and risk occupational injury and disease from exposure to dangerous 
tools, insecticides and herbicides. Children’s injuries include fractures, dislocations and sprains, burns, frostbite, breathing 
problems, skin problems, extreme fatigue, and snake bites. The release of this survey demonstrates the Government of 
Eswatini’s commitment to addressing child labor and its acknowledgment that data collection is vital to the design and 
implementation of sound policies and programs.

India – Mica – Child Labor
There are reports that children ages 5 to 17 are engaged in collecting mica from abandoned mines, primarily in illegal 
mining operations in India. Children are primarily found mining in the major mica-producing states of Bihar, Jharkhand, and 
Rajasthan, often in lieu of attending school. NGOs and media sources have documented hundreds of children working in 

54

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRSmica across these states. Children’s tasks reportedly include breaking apart rocks to mine the minerals, carrying loads of 
rocks, and sorting and separating mica from other mined minerals. According to media reports and interviews, children’s 
inhalation of mica dust has contributed to respiratory health issues. Children also reportedly experience other health 
and safety hazards, resulting in injuries such as scorpion bites and broken bones, or in some cases, even death in poorly-
maintained and unregulated mineshafts.

Mexico – Chile Peppers – Forced Labor 
There are reports that men and women are forced to work in the production of chile peppers in Mexico. According to media 
reports, NGOs, and the U.S. Department of State, there are hundreds of forced labor victims working to produce chile 
peppers. Many of these victims report being recruited by middlemen, called enganchadores, that lie to workers about 
the nature and conditions of the work, wages, hours, and quality of living conditions. Sources report that cases of forced 
labor in chile peppers production predominantly occurs in small and medium holder farms and have been found in states 
such as Baja California, Chihuahua, Jalisco, and San Luis Potosi. According to available reports, indigenous farmworkers 
from impoverished regions of central and southern Mexico are particularly vulnerable to forced labor in the agricultural 
sector due to low education levels, linguistic barriers, and discrimination. Once on the farms, some men and women work 
up to 15 hours per day under the threat of dismissal and receive subminimum wage payments or no payment at all. There 
are reports of some workers being threatened with physical violence or physically abused for leaving their jobs. Workers 
also report finding themselves in overcrowded and unsanitary housing facilities with no access to potable water, latrines, 
electricity, and medical care. Some workers face growing indebtedness to company stores that often inflate the prices of 
their goods, forcing workers to purchase provisions on credit and limiting their ability to leave the farms.

There are reports that children as young as 7 years old cultivate and harvest poppies in Mexico, especially in impoverished 
indigenous communities where they work alongside family members. Opium from the poppy plant is a highly addictive 
narcotic that is used in the production of illegal drugs, such as heroin. According to media reports, NGOs, Government of 
Mexico reports, and the U.S. Department of State, child labor has been reported in remote areas of Guerrero, including 
in the mountainous regions of La Montaña and La Sierra where most of the poppy fields are located. Many children miss 
school to work in the fields during harvest time, often work long hours in hazardous environments, and use sharp tools to 
extract the opium from the poppy plant.

Paraguay – Beans – Child Labor
There is evidence that children ages 5 to 17 grow beans in Paraguay. In 2016, the Government of Paraguay published 
representative results from the Survey of Activities of Rural Area Children and Adolescents 2015. The survey considers 
a working child to be engaged in child labor if the child is below the minimum age for employment of 14 or is performing 
work that is hazardous according to national legislation. The survey estimates that 301,827 children ages 5 to 17 perform 
hazardous work in rural areas of Paraguay and indicates that children working in agriculture experience accidents and 
illnesses, including from using dangerous tools and handling chemicals. According to the survey, almost 13 percent 
of Paraguayan children engaged in child labor in agriculture do not attend school. The survey estimates that 71,839 
child laborers grow poroto beans throughout rural areas in Paraguay. Approximately 31,372 of child laborers growing

occurs in the cultivation of other varieties of beans, including habilla, poroto manteca, and feijao, and that more boys 
than girls are engaged in child labor producing beans. The release of this survey demonstrates the Government of 
Paraguay’s commitment to addressing child labor and its acknowledgment that data collection is vital to the design and 
implementation of sound policies and programs.

Russia – Bricks – Forced Labor
There are reports that adults are forced to produce bricks in Russia. Both men and women are exploited for forced labor 
in informal brick factories in the Northern Caucasus region of Dagestan; however, victims are primarily male job-seekers 
recruited in Moscow. According to a local NGO and media reports, hundreds of individuals have been subjected to forced 
labor in brick factories. Recruiters in Moscow frequently drug and abduct victims who are then sold to brick factory 
owners in Dagestan. Other victims are recruited through deception regarding the location of work and the anticipated 
wages. Victims and a local NGO report that factories frequently withhold all wages, sometimes confiscate workers’ 
passports and cellphones, and sometimes use physical violence, especially when workers try to leave.

Russia – Timber – Forced Labor 
There are reports that adults are forced to produce timber in Russia. Adults from North Korea are sent to Russia to 
produce timber by the North Korean government. According to media reports, approximately 2,000 North Koreans 
produce timber in Russia. A South Korean NGO reports that North Korean workers in the forestry sector work from 12 to 
18 hours a day under growing debts incurred to pay bribes during the selection process. Many workers in the sector are 
isolated in remote, prison-like logging camps in the far east of the country. An NGO reports that workers are forced to 
remit 80 percent of their wages to the North Korean government in addition to paying for room and board, and are allowed 
to keep only $30 to $50 per month, far below the minimum wage. In compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 2397, 
Russia announced its intention in 2017 to cease issuing or renewing work visas for North Korean workers.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS2018  LIST OF GOODS PRODUCED BY CHILD LABOR OR FORCED LABORTurkey – Footwear – Child Labor 
There are reports that children as young as 9 produce footwear in Turkey. Both boys and girls, including many in the Syrian 
refugee community, are engaged in work activities in this sector. According to international organizations, NGOs, and 
media sources, there is credible evidence that the use of child labor is common in footwear production, including in major 
production areas such as Gaziantep and Istanbul. Children work long hours, with some reports of working up to 12 hours per 
day, 6 days per week. Due to the long hours worked, many child workers in this sector are unable to attend school. Some 
child laborers in this sector use hazardous chemicals, machinery, and materials.

Turkey – Garments – Child Labor 
There are reports that children as young as 10 produce garments in Turkey. Both boys and girls, including many in the Syrian 
refugee community, are engaged in work activities in this sector. According to international organizations, NGOs, and 
media sources, there is credible evidence of the use of child labor in small and medium-sized garment manufacturers in 
various cities nationwide, including Gaziantep, Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir. Children work long hours, with some reporting 
working up to 15 hours per day, 6 days per week, and earn exceptionally low wages. Due to the long hours worked, many 
child laborers in this sector are unable to attend school. Reports indicate that conditions of work in the garment industry 
are often poor, with crowded, informal workshops often lacking proper ventilation and reaching high temperatures in the 
summer.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRSUganda – Sand – Child Labor
There are reports that school-aged children harvest sand in Uganda, particularly in the Central, Eastern, and Northeastern 
regions of the country. According to a Government of Uganda official, sand harvesting is one of the main occupations in 
which child laborers work. Children harvest sand for long hours, which prevents them from attending school. Children dive 
underwater, scoop up sand, and transport it to boats on the river bank. This work exposes children to severe health and 
safety hazards, including drowning, injury, and water-borne disease.

Ukraine – Amber – Child Labor
There are reports that children as young as 7 engage in illegal amber extraction in Ukraine. Children from low-income 
families in the Polesia region of western Ukraine, including in Rivne, Volyn, and Zhytomyr Oblasts, are particularly 
vulnerable to involvement in amber extraction. For example, one human rights organization reports that thousands of 
school children extract amber, and that their labor is essential to the amber industry. According to media reports and 
local government officials, child labor is systemic in the illegal amber extraction industry and is a growing problem. The 
amber extraction process creates large pits and exposes children to risk of injuries when extraction pits collapse. Children 
engaged in illegal amber extraction are also at risk of violence at the mining site.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS2018  LIST OF GOODS PRODUCED BY CHILD LABOR OR FORCED LABORAppendix 2

Methodology
Research Focus

The research methodology used to compile the TVPRA List is based on ILAB’s Procedural Guidelines. For this edition, 
ILAB reviewed new information on goods from 154 countries and territories. See above for a link to the list of these 
countries and territories. ILAB continues to carry out research for future editions of the TVPRA List.

Population Covered
In researching child labor, ILAB focused on children under the age of 18 years. For forced labor, the research covered 
workers of all ages. The population included persons in foreign countries only, as directed by statute. Populations 
within the United States were not included in this study.

Nature of Employment
Where ILAB research indicated situations of exploitative working conditions, these situations were reviewed to 
determine whether they constituted “child labor” or “forced labor” under international labor standards. ILAB’s 
complete definitions of child labor and forced labor can be found in its Procedural Guidelines.

 “Child labor’’ under international standards means all work performed by a person below the age of 15. It 
also includes all work performed by a person below the age of 18 in the following practices: (A) All forms of 
slavery or practices similar to slavery, such as the sale or trafficking of children, debt bondage and serfdom, 
or forced or compulsory labor, including forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed 
conflict; (B) the use, procuring or offering of a child for prostitution, for the production of pornography or 
for pornographic purposes; (C) the use, procuring or offering of a child for illicit activities in particular for 
the production and trafficking of drugs; and (D) work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is 
carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children.i  

The definitions used in developing the TVPRA List are based on standards adopted by the ILO. The ILO has 
adopted two conventions relating to child labor, the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (C. 138) and the Worst 
Forms of Child Labor Convention, 1999 (C. 182). The ILO has also adopted two conventions relating to forced 
labor, the Forced Labor Convention, 1930 (C. 29) and the Abolition of Forced Labor Convention, 1957 (C. 
105). 

“Forced labor’’ under international standards means all work or service which is exacted from any person 
under the menace of any penalty for its nonperformance and for which the worker does not offer himself 
voluntarily, and includes indentured labor. ‘‘Forced labor’’ includes work provided or obtained by force, fraud 
or coercion, including: (1) by threats of serious harm to, or physical restraint against any person; (2) by means 
of any scheme, plan or pattern intended to cause the person to believe that, if the person did not perform such 
labor or services, that person or another person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint; or (3) by 
means of the abuse or threatened abuse of law or the legal process.ii  

Evidence of child labor and forced labor was considered separately to determine whether—for each good on the 
TVPRA List—there should be a finding that child labor, forced labor, or both were used in the production of the good 
in violation of international standards. Some goods are listed as produced with both child labor and forced labor, but 
this does not necessarily mean that the goods were produced with forced child labor.

66

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRSSector of Employment
The TVPRA List comprises goods from the agricultural, manufacturing, and mining/quarrying sectors, as well as 
pornography. ILAB’s research did not include the service sector, which was beyond the scope of the legislated 
mandate.

Type of Employment
Research covered all economic activity for adults and children in the production of goods, including formal and 
informal sector production and goods produced for personal and family consumption. Examples of informal sector 
activity include day labor hired without contract; small-scale farming and fishing; artisanal mining and quarrying; and 
manufacturing work performed in home-based workshops. 

The TVPRA List includes many goods for which ILAB has evidence of child labor or forced labor only in informal sector 
production. These include garments from Bangladesh, gold from Suriname, and tobacco from Tanzania. 

Some illicit goods are also included in the TVPRA List; this is not intended to condone or legitimize the production or 
consumption of these goods.

Stage of Production
Goods are placed on the TVPRA List at the stage of production at which ILAB determined that there was reason to 
believe that child labor or forced labor was involved. For example, if there was reason to believe that child labor or 
forced labor was used in the extraction, harvesting, assembly or production of raw materials or component articles 
and these materials or articles are subsequently used as inputs in the manufacture or processing of final goods 
under non-violative conditions, only the raw materials or component articles are included on the TVPRA List and 
only for those countries where they were extracted, harvested, assembled or produced. If child labor or forced labor 
was used in both the production and extraction of raw materials or component articles and the manufacture or 
processing of final goods, the raw materials or component articles and the final goods are included on the TVPRA List 
for those countries where the violative conditions were found. 

In placing items on the TVPRA List, ILAB names the most specific good possible given the available evidence. 
Therefore, ILAB may identify child labor or forced labor in the production of a general category of good from one 
country (e.g., stones from Nepal), while it may have evidence of labor exploitation in the production of a more precise 
good from another country (e.g., limestone from Egypt). However, ILAB does not place broad sectors on the TVPRA 
List. For example, though there is evidence of child labor in agriculture in nearly every country in the world, ILAB 
would not include “agricultural goods” on the TVPRA List. However, when there is credible evidence of child labor or 
forced labor in a particular agricultural good, that specific good would be included on the TVPRA List.

Market for Goods
Most economically active children are involved in the production of goods or services for local consumption,iv 
rather than for international trade. Data is limited on the consumption patterns of goods made with forced labor. In 
conducting research, ILAB did not distinguish between goods produced for domestic consumption and for export, 
due to data limitations and because this is not part of the mandate of the TVPRA.
 

Data Sources and Analysis 
Sources and Collection of Data
To ensure a transparent process, ILAB will not accept classified information in developing the List. ILAB utilized 
a wide variety of publicly-available primary and secondary sources to conduct the research. Primary sources 

67

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS2018  LIST OF GOODS PRODUCED BY CHILD LABOR OR FORCED LABORinclude original quantitative and qualitative research studies and other data or evidence gathered first-hand, 
while secondary sources are those that cite, comment on or build upon primary sources. ILAB’s primary sources 
included surveys carried out by foreign governments in conjunction with the ILO; site visits and data gathered by 
ILAB staff and other U.S. Government personnel; and quantitative and qualitative studies carried out by a variety 
of governmental and nongovernmental entities, including academic institutions. Where available, ILAB relied on 
statistically representative studies in which participants are chosen through random sampling. This type of research 
produces reliable estimates of the number of individuals in child labor or forced labor working in particular activities 
in a given sector or geographic area. Because these studies provide empirical, quantitative evidence about both the 
nature and prevalence of the problem, ILAB sometimes based a determination to add a good to the TVPRA List on a 
single, representative survey when it was confident in the rigor of the methodology and execution. 

ILAB’s secondary sources included information reported by U.S. Government agencies, foreign governments and 
civil society organizations, including reporting from U.S. Government-funded technical assistance projects. The 
Department of State and U.S. embassies and consulates abroad provided important information by gathering data 
from local contacts, conducting site visits and reviewing local media sources. ILAB issued a notice in the Federal 
Register requesting information from the public on child labor and forced labor in the production of goods globally 
and reached out to the embassies of all countries researched requesting this information, as well. ILAB monitored 
reports from international institutions, non-governmental organizations, and academic journals and media sources 
on an ongoing basis. 

Data Analysis
The TVPRA mandates USDOL to publish a List of goods that ILAB has “reason to believe” are produced using 
forced or child labor in violation of international standards. ILAB implemented this “reason to believe” standard 
by establishing five factors to be considered in evaluating information. These five factors are included in ILAB’s 
Procedural Guidelines. 

1. Nature of information. Whether the information about child labor or forced labor gathered from research, 
public submissions, hearing testimony or other sources is relevant, probative and meets the definitions of 
child labor or forced labor.

2. Date of information. Whether the information about child labor or forced labor is no more than 7 years old at 
the time of receipt. More current information will generally be given priority, and information older than 7 
years will generally not be considered.v 

3. Source of information. Whether the information, either from primary or secondary sources, is from a source 

whose methodology, prior publications, degree of familiarity and experience with international labor 
standards and/or reputation for accuracy and objectivity warrants a determination that it is relevant and 
probative.

4. Extent of corroboration. The extent to which the information about the use of child labor or forced labor in the 

production of a good(s) is corroborated by other sources.

5. Significant incidence of child labor or forced labor. Whether the information about the use of child labor or 
forced labor in the production of a good(s) warrants a determination that the incidence of such practices 
is significant in the country in question. Information that relates only to a single company or facility or that 
indicates an isolated incident of child labor or forced labor will not ordinarily weigh in favor of a finding that a 
good is produced in violation of international standards. Information that demonstrates a significant incidence 
of child labor or forced labor in the production of a particular good, although not necessarily representing 
a practice in the industry as a whole, will ordinarily weigh in favor of a finding that a good is produced in 
violation of international standards.

For each good that was reviewed, ILAB evaluated each data source against each of the five criteria. ILAB 
researchers applied the criteria consistently across goods and countries so that ultimate findings of “reason to 
believe” are consistent worldwide. 

68

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRSWhere ILAB found reason to believe that child labor or forced labor was used in the production of a particular good, 
prior to adding that good to the TVPRA List, ILAB also considered evidence of government, industry or third party 
initiatives to combat the problem. This included evidence about ongoing initiatives brought to our attention through 
public submissions. If ILAB determined that the problem of child labor or forced labor persisted despite existing 
efforts to address the issue, the good was still added to the TVPRA List. If the only evidence ILAB had about child 
labor or forced labor in the production of a good discussed government law enforcement or other efforts to address 
or remediate the problem, ILAB did not use that evidence to place a good on the List.

Limitations
Data Availability
A wide range of challenges contributes to the continued scarcity of information on international child labor and 
forced labor.

Countries Not Appearing on the TVPRA List
A country’s absence from the TVPRA List does not necessarily indicate that child labor and/or forced labor are 
not occurring in the production of goods in that country. Data can be unavailable for various reasons, including 
both research and policy considerations. Forced laborers often work in isolated locations, such as rural areas, or 
clandestine settings, such as workshops hidden in large cities. Research survey methodologies on such hard-to-reach 
populations, especially for individuals in forced labor, are still in developmental stages and continue to be piloted and 
refined in order to capture the appropriate constructs. While research on child labor is more advanced, and has gone 
beyond population estimates, data on the specific types of work in which children are involved beyond aggregated 
industry data are still not collected in a universal manner. For example, national child labor surveys often produce 
estimates of the number of children working in agriculture, but statistics are often not available on the specific 
agricultural goods children are producing. Policy decisions that affect the availability of data on child labor or forced 
labor include government failure to allocate sufficient financial resources or hesitancy to collect and make publicly 
available data on such sensitive issues. ILAB seeks to corroborate information with multiple sources; however, in 
some instances only certain types of sources are available. For example, in cases where only media sources are 
available, ILAB will review the body of evidence against its five criteria to determine if it can establish a “reason to 
believe.” 

The existence of child labor and forced labor also often involves violations of laws and regulations, including serious 
criminal violations in some cases. Information may be intentionally suppressed to protect powerful interests, in the 
face of which the victims of these egregious labor practices may be too vulnerable or politically weak to assert their 
rights or even communicate their situations. Among the 154 countries and territories researched for this edition of 
the TVPRA List, there were several for which ILAB could not find adequate information to determine that any goods 
should be placed on the TVPRA List because very little recent research on child labor and forced labor has been done 
in those countries. This was the case, for example, in Algeria, Gabon, Guyana, Jamaica, Maldives, Morocco, South 
Africa, Togo, Tunisia, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe.

Countries with Data Gaps on TVPRA List
ILAB’s TVPRA List includes goods from some countries known to restrict data collection on forced labor and child 
labor or to suppress information dissemination. Examples include China, Iran, and North Korea. Where ILAB was 
able to find even limited sources, despite data availability constraints, indicating significant incidence of forced 
labor or child labor in the production of a particular good, and these sources were judged credible and timely, ILAB 
determined that there was “reason to believe” that child labor or forced labor was occurring with respect to that 
good.

69

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS2018  LIST OF GOODS PRODUCED BY CHILD LABOR OR FORCED LABORCountries with Disproportionate Representation on the TVPRA List
Some countries with relatively large numbers of goods on the TVPRA List may not have the most serious 
problems of child labor or forced labor. Often, these are countries that have more openly acknowledged 
the problems, have better research and have allowed information on these issues to be disseminated. Such 
countries include Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, India, Kenya, Mexico, Paraguay, 
Philippines, Tanzania, Turkey, Uganda, Vietnam, and Zambia. The number of goods on the TVPRA List from any 
particular country should not be interpreted as a direct indicator that these countries have the most extensive 
problems of child labor or forced labor.

Generalizability of Findings
The TVPRA List is comprised of goods and countries that ILAB found to have a significant incidence of child 
labor and/or forced labor. However, it is important to understand that a listing of any particular good and 
country cannot be generalized to all production of that good in the country. In a given country there may be 
firms that produce the good in compliance with the law and international standards, and others that employ 
child labor and forced labor. The TVPRA List does not name specific companies using child labor or forced 
labor. It would be immensely difficult for ILAB to attempt to track the identity of every company producing 
a good using child labor or forced labor. In addition, it is ILAB’s experience that child labor and forced 
labor frequently occur in small local enterprises, for which company names, if they are available, have little 
relevance. ILAB is also aware that it is often a simple matter to change or conceal the name of a company. 
Consequently, ILAB has concluded that seeking to track and name individual companies would be of limited 
value to the primary purpose of the TVPRA List, which is to promote ameliorative efforts at the country and 
sector levels.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 
105(b)(1) of the Trafficking Victims 
Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 
(‘‘TVPRA of 2005’’), Public Law 109– 
164 (2006), directed the Secretary of 
Labor, acting through the Bureau of 
International Labor Affairs, to ‘‘carry out 
additional activities to monitor and 
combat forced labor and child labor in 
foreign countries.’’ Section 105(b)(2) of 
the TVPRA, 22 U.S.C. 7112(b)(2), listed 
these activities as: 

(A) Monitor the use of forced labor 

and child labor in violation of 
international standards; 

(B) Provide information regarding 

trafficking in persons for the purpose of 
forced labor to the Office to Monitor and 
Combat Trafficking of the Department of 
State for inclusion in [the] trafficking in 
persons report required by section 

110(b) of the Trafficking Victims 
Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 
7107(b)); 

(C) Develop and make available to the 
public a list of goods from countries that 
the Bureau of International Labor Affairs 
has reason to believe are produced by 
forced labor or child labor in violation 
of international standards; 

(D) Work with persons who are 

involved in the production of goods on 
the list described in subparagraph (C) to 
create a standard set of practices that 
will reduce the likelihood that such 
persons will produce goods using the 
labor described in such subparagraph; 
and 

(E) Consult with other departments 

and agencies of the United States 
Government to reduce forced and child 
labor internationally and ensure that 
products made by forced labor and child 
labor in violation of international 
standards are not imported into the 
United States. 

The Office carries out the DOL 

mandates in the TVPRA. These 
Guidelines provide the framework for 
ILAB’s implementation of the TVPRA 
mandate, and establish procedures for 
the submission and review of 
information and the process for 
developing and maintaining the List. In 
addition to the Office’s efforts under the 
TVPRA, the Office conducts and 
publishes research on child labor and 
forced labor worldwide. The Office 
consults such sources as DOL’s Findings 
on the Worst Forms of Child Labor; the 
Department of State’s annual Country 
Reports on Human Rights Practices and 
Trafficking in Persons Reports; reports 
by governmental, non-governmental, 
and international organizations; and 
reports by academic and research 
institutions and other sources. 

In addition to reviewing information 
submitted by the public in response to 
this Notice, the Office will also conduct 
a public hearing to gather information to 
assist in the development of the List. 
The Office will evaluate all information 
received according to the processes 
outlined in these Guidelines. Goods that 
meet the criteria outlined in these 
Guidelines will be placed on an initial 
List, published in the Federal Register 
and on the DOL Web site. DOL intends 
to maintain and update the List over 
time, through its own research, 
interagency consultations, and 
additional public submissions of 
information. Procedures for the ongoing 
maintenance of the List, and key terms 
used in these Guidelines, are described 
in detail below.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS2018  LIST OF GOODS PRODUCED BY CHILD LABOR OR FORCED LABORFederal  Register / Vol.  72,  No.  247 / Thursday,  December  27,  2007 / Notices 

73375 

Public Comments 

On October 1, 2007, ILAB published 
a Federal Register notice of proposed 
procedural guidelines, requesting public 
comments on the proposed guidelines 
(72 FR 55808 (Oct. 1, 2007)). The notice 
provided a 30-day period for submitting 
written comments, which closed on Oct. 
31, 2007. Written comments were 
received from nine parties. Several of 
the comments strongly supported the 
Department’s efforts to combat child 
labor and forced labor. All of the 
comments were given careful 
consideration and where appropriate, 
changes were made to the Guidelines. 
The comments and any revisions to the 
proposed Guidelines are explained in 
detail below. 
A. Comments Concerning the Office’s 
Evaluation of Information 

Several commenters questioned the 

Department’s decision to consider 
information up to seven years old. One 
commenter asserted that even one-year- 
old information should be considered 
too dated to be relevant. The 
Department appreciates the importance 
of using up-to-date information. It is 
also the Office’s experience that the use 
of child labor and forced labor in a 
country or in the production of a 
particular good typically persists for 
several years, particularly when no 
meaningful action is taken to combat it. 
Information about such activities is 
often actively concealed. Information 
that is several years old therefore can 
provide useful context for more current 
information. The Office will consider 
the date of all available information, 
and, as stated in the proposed 
Guidelines, ‘‘more current information 
will generally be given priority.’’ 

One commenter questioned how the 

Office would treat information on 
government efforts to combat the use of 
child labor and forced labor, stating that 
where a government undertakes 
voluntary efforts to regulate the 
production of goods and/or prosecutes 
incidents of child labor or forced labor, 
such government initiatives should not 
result in designating a particular good 
on the List. In response, the Office 
affirms the important role of 
government law enforcement, as well as 
other government, private sector, and 
third-party voluntary actions and 
initiatives to combat child labor and 
forced labor such as company and 
industry codes of conduct. However, the 
Office notes that some voluntary 
actions, as with some enforcement 
actions, are more effective than others. 
For example, some prosecutions may 
result in minimal or suspended 

sentences for the responsible parties, 
and some voluntary actions by 
government, industry, or third parties, 
may be ineffective in combating the 
violative labor practices at issue. 
Accordingly, in determining whether to 
include a good and country on the List, 
the Office will consider particularly 
relevant and probative any available 
evidence of government, industry, and 
third-party actions and initiatives that 
are effective in significantly reducing if 
not eliminating child labor and forced 
labor. 

Two commenters questioned why the 
Office would not consider confidential 
information in a submission, with one 
commenter stating that a submitter 
should have the option of providing 
information containing confidential 
information to the Office while also 
providing a redacted version for public 
release. In response, the Office has 
clarified its handling of submissions 
containing confidential, personal, or 
classified information. In the interest of 
maintaining a transparent process, the 
Office will not accept classified 
information in developing the List. The 
Office may request that any such 
information brought to its attention be 
declassified. The Office will accept 
submissions containing confidential or 
personal information, but pursuant to 
applicable laws and regulations may 
redact such submissions before making 
them publicly available. 
B. Comments Concerning the List of 
Goods and Countries 

Several commenters questioned why 
the List includes raw materials and/or 
components directly produced using 
child labor and forced labor, but not 
final goods made in part (indirectly 
produced) with such materials or 
components. Another commenter 
suggested that any final good produced 
indirectly with child labor or forced 
labor at any point in its production 
chain should be placed on the List, and 
that the List should specify where in the 
production chain the child labor or 
forced labor occurred. While the Office 
appreciates the importance of tracking 
raw materials or components produced 
in violation of international child labor 
or forced labor standards through the 
production chain, the difficulty of 
accurately conducting such tracking 
places it beyond the scope of these 
Guidelines. Ideally, the Office would 
have access to public information that 
would permit the comprehensive 
tracking of raw materials and 
component parts in the global supply 
chain, but the Office is unaware of any 
such publicly available information. 
Moreover, the Office is aware that many 

goods used as raw materials or 
components in the production of other 
goods may be sourced from multiple 
locations within a country or even from 
several different countries. 
Consequently, it would likely be 
extremely difficult to develop reliable 
information on the final destination or 
use of every good produced with child 
labor or forced labor. Inasmuch as the 
primary purpose of the List is to 
promote efforts at the country level to 
combat child labor and forced labor, 
that purpose is best served by 
identifying goods directly produced 
with child labor and forced labor. The 
Office observes that nothing in these 
Guidelines would prevent a member of 
the public from tracking the final 
destination or use of any good on the 
List. 

Several commenters requested that 
the List name individual companies 
using child labor or forced labor, with 
two commenters suggesting that this 
practice would protect entities that do 
not use child labor or forced labor in 
their supply chains, or that might 
otherwise unknowingly trade in such 
goods. One commenter suggested that, 
in addition to listing goods and 
countries, the Office name industries 
using such goods. Another commenter 
suggested that the Office distinguish 
among individual factories within a 
country on the List, to ensure that goods 
not produced with child labor or forced 
labor are not subject to the same 
treatment as goods that are so produced. 
Another commenter suggested that the 
Department hold individual violators 
publicly accountable. 

The TVPRA mandated a List of goods 
and countries, not company or industry 
names. It would be immensely difficult 
for the Office to attempt to track the 
identity of every company and industry 
using a good produced with child labor 
or forced labor. In addition, it is the 
Office’s experience that child labor and 
forced labor frequently occur in small 
local enterprises, for which company 
names, if they are available, have little 
relevance. The Office is also aware that 
it is often a simple matter to change or 
conceal the name of a company. 
Consequently, the Office has concluded 
that seeking to track and name 
individual companies would be of 
limited value to the primary purpose of 
the List, which is to promote 
ameliorative efforts at the country level. 
Moreover, holding individual violators 
accountable would exceed the mandate 
of the TVPRA of 2005. However, the 
TVPRA of 2005 requires that the 
Department work with persons who are 
involved in the production of goods on 
the List to create a standard set of

practices to reduce the likelihood that 
such persons will produce goods using 
such labor. The Department intends to 
work with such persons once the initial 
List is developed. 
C. Comments Concerning the 
Development and Maintenance of the 
List 

One commenter suggested that the 

List be updated at regular intervals, and 
at least annually. Another commenter 
noted that the proposed Guidelines do 
not set a limit on how long a good may 
remain on the List, or a time period 
within which DOL must review the 
designation of a particular good. The 
Office anticipates that the addition, 
maintenance, or removal of an item on 
the List will be driven largely by the 
availability of accurate information. The 
Office will conduct its own research on 
goods produced with child labor and 
forced labor, and anticipates that 
additional information used to develop 
and maintain the List will be provided 
by the public. Consequently, the Office 
considers it a more efficient use of 
resources to re-examine goods on the 
List as pertinent information becomes 
available, rather than adhering to a fixed 
review schedule. 

One commenter suggested that the 

Office provide a fixed time period 
within which it will decide whether to 
accept a submission of information. The 
Office has revised section B.3 of the 
Guidelines to remove the possibility 
that a submission of information will 
not be accepted. All submissions of 
information (with the exception of those 
containing classified information) will 
be accepted and evaluated for their 
relevance and probative value. 

One commenter suggested that the 

Guidelines provide that the Office make 
a final determination whether to place 
a good on the List within a specific 
timeframe, such as within 120 days of 
receiving the submission. Although the 
Office intends to expedite its evaluation 
of any information submitted in 
response to this notice, it cannot 
guarantee that the Office’s evaluation of 
a particular submission will be 
completed within a set timeframe. Some 
submissions may require further 
investigation by the Office, and other 
submissions may result in responsive 
submissions by other parties. Setting a 
fixed deadline may result in the 
inclusion or exclusion of a good on the 
List without the most comprehensive 
review possible. 

One commenter suggested that before 

an entry is removed from the List, the 
Office should publish a notice in the 
Federal Register announcing its 
intention to consider removal of the 

entry and giving interested parties an 
opportunity to comment. The Office 
does not intend to provide advance 
notice before an item is added to or 
removed from the List; however, if 
information is submitted that tends to 
support a change to the List, that 
information will be publicly available 
on the Office’s Web site and will 
provide notice to the public that the 
status of a particular good is under 
review. Moreover, the Office retains the 
discretion to request additional 
information from time to time 
concerning a particular good; such a 
request will also provide notice to the 
public that the status of a good is under 
active consideration. 

One commenter suggested that the 

Office ensure that any information 
indicating a possible violation of U.S. 
law is referred to an appropriate law 
enforcement agency. The Department 
has well-established procedures for the 
referral of information indicating a 
possible violation of U.S. laws to 
appropriate law enforcement agencies, 
and these procedures will be followed 
throughout the development and 
maintenance of the List. 
D. Comments Concerning Definitions 
and Terms 

Two commenters were concerned 

about the definitions of child labor and 
forced labor in the proposed Guidelines, 
questioning why they did not expressly 
reference International Labor 
Organization (ILO) conventions 
addressing child labor and forced labor. 
The commenters questioned why there 
were apparent differences between the 
definitions of terms in the proposed 
Guidelines and the corresponding 
definitions in the relevant ILO 
conventions. The Office has carefully 
considered these comments. 
Consequently, the definitions used in 
the final Guidelines have been revised 
to clarify that the Office will apply 
international standards. 

Four commenters questioned the use 
of the terms ‘‘significant incidence’’ and 
‘‘isolated incident’’ in the proposed 
Guidelines. One commenter raised an 
apparent inconsistency between the 
terms ‘‘significant,’’ ‘‘prevalent,’’ and 
‘‘pattern of practice,’’ in the proposed 
Guidelines’ description of the amount of 
evidence that would weigh in favor of 
a finding that a particular good is 
produced in violation of international 
standards. Another commenter stated 
that the terms ‘‘significant’’ and 
‘‘prevalent’’ provide inadequate 
guidance, because they do not address 
the percentage of workplaces in a 
country producing a particular good in 
violation of international standards, or 

whether a good produced in one 
location represents a large or small 
share of a country’s total exports of the 
good. One commenter recommended 
that the terms ‘‘significant’’ and 
‘‘prevalent’’ be replaced with 
‘‘recurring.’’ Another commenter 
recommended that a more precise 
guideline be developed with respect to 
how much child labor or forced labor 
warrants the placement of a good on the 
List. One final commenter on this issue 
suggested that a good be removed from 
the List only if the use of child labor or 
forced labor is ‘‘insignificant,’’ stating 
that that term is more precise than the 
terms used in the proposed Guidelines. 

It is neither possible nor useful to 

precisely quantify the amount or 
percentage of child labor or forced labor 
that will be considered ‘‘significant,’’ 
since what is considered ‘‘significant’’ 
will vary with a number of other factors. 
For that reason, the Guidelines provide 
that a ‘‘significant incidence’’ of child 
labor or forced labor occurring in the 
production of a particular good is only 
one among several factors that would be 
weighed before a good is added to, or 
removed from, the List. Other factors 
include whether the situation described 
meets the definitions of child labor or 
forced labor; the probative value of the 
evidence submitted; the date and 
source(s) of the information; and the 
extent to which the information is 
corroborated. The Guidelines also make 
clear that the Office will consider any 
available evidence of government, 
industry, and third-party actions and 
initiatives that are effective in 
significantly reducing if not eliminating 
child labor and forced labor. However, 
in response to these comments, the 
Office has decided to clarify the nature 
of the information sought by deleting 
the use of the term ‘‘prevalent.’’ The 
Office will also change the phrase, 
‘‘pattern of practice,’’ to ‘‘pattern or 
practice.’’ The suggested terms 
‘‘recurring’’ or ‘‘insignificant’’ provide 
no additional precision. 

Two commenters requested that the 

goods on the List be identified as 
specifically as possible, to avoid 
confusion with similar goods that have 
not been produced using child labor or 
forced labor in violation of international 
standards. Some commenters suggested 
that the List use product codes 
developed for the Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule (HTS), reasoning that the use 
of such codes would both provide more 
specificity and improve interagency 
consultation. The Office intends to 
identify all goods on the List as 
specifically as possible, depending on 
available information. However, parties 
submitting information on a particular

good may not have the necessary 
expertise to properly utilize the product 
codes developed for the HTS. 

Another commenter suggested that 

the Office specifically include 
agricultural commodities in the 
definition of ‘‘goods.’’ The Office 
considers that the term ‘‘goods’’ 
includes agricultural products and the 
definition of ‘‘produced’’ in the 
Guidelines expressly covers goods that 
are harvested or farmed. 
Final Procedural Guidelines 
A. Sources of Information and Factors 
Considered in the Development and 
Maintenance of the List 

The Office will make use of all 

relevant information, whether gathered 
through research, public submissions of 
information, a public hearing, 
interagency consultations, or other 
means, in developing the List. In the 
interest of maintaining a transparent 
process, the Office will not accept 
classified information in developing the 
List. The Office may request that any 
such information brought to its attention 
be declassified. If submissions contain 
confidential or personal information, 
the Office may redact such information 
in accordance with applicable laws and 
regulations before making the 
submission available to the public. 

In evaluating information, the Office 
will consider and weigh several factors, 
including: 

1. Nature of information. Whether the 
information about child labor or forced 
labor gathered from research, public 
submissions, hearing testimony, or other 
sources is relevant and probative, and 
meets the definitions of child labor or 
forced labor. 

2. Date of information. Whether the 

information about child labor or forced 
labor in the production of the good(s) is 
no more than 7 years old at the time of 
receipt. More current information will 
generally be given priority, and 
information older than 7 years will 
generally not be considered. 

3. Source of information. Whether the 

information, either from primary or 
secondary sources, is from a source 
whose methodology, prior publications, 
degree of familiarity and experience 
with international labor standards, and/ 
or reputation for accuracy and 
objectivity, warrants a determination 
that it is relevant and probative. 

4. Extent of corroboration. The extent 
to which the information about the use 
of child labor or forced labor in the 
production of a good(s) is corroborated 
by other sources. 

5. Significant incidence of child labor 

or forced labor. Whether the 

information about the use of child labor 
or forced labor in the production of a 
good(s) warrants a determination that 
the incidence of such practices is 
significant in the country in question. 
Information that relates only to a single 
company or facility; or that indicates an 
isolated incident of child labor or forced 
labor, will ordinarily not weigh in favor 
of a finding that a good is produced in 
violation of international standards. 
Information that demonstrates a 
significant incidence of child labor or 
forced labor in the production of a 
particular good(s), although not 
necessarily representing a pattern or 
practice in the industry as a whole, will 
ordinarily weigh in favor of a finding 
that a good is produced in violation of 
international standards. 

In determining which goods and 

countries are to be placed on the List, 
the Office will, as appropriate, take into 
consideration the stages in the chain of 
a good’s production. Whether a good is 
placed on the List may depend on 
which stage of production used child 
labor or forced labor. For example, if 
child labor or forced labor was only 
used in the extraction, harvesting, 
assembly, or production of raw 
materials or component articles, and 
these materials or articles are 
subsequently used under non-violative 
conditions in the manufacture or 
processing of a final good, only the raw 
materials/component articles and the 
country/ies where they were extracted, 
harvested, assembled, or produced, as 
appropriate, may be placed on the List. 
If child labor or forced labor was used 
in both the production or extraction of 
raw materials/component articles and 
the manufacture or processing of a final 
good, then both the raw materials/ 
component articles and the final good, 
and the country/ies in which such labor 
was used, may be placed on the List. 
This is to ensure a direct 
correspondence between the goods and 
countries which appear on the List, and 
the use of child labor or forced labor. 

Information on government, industry, 
or third-party actions and initiatives to 
combat child labor or forced labor will 
be taken into consideration, although 
they are not necessarily sufficient in and 
of themselves to prevent a good and 
country from being listed. In evaluating 
such information, the Office will 
consider particularly relevant and 
probative any evidence of government, 
industry, and third-party actions and 
initiatives that are effective in 
significantly reducing if not eliminating 
child labor and forced labor. 

Goods and countries (‘‘entries’’) that 

meet the criteria outlined in these 
procedural Guidelines will be placed on 

an initial List, to be published in the 
Federal Register and on the DOL Web 
site. This initial List will continue to be 
updated as additional information 
becomes available. Before publication of 
the initial List or subsequent versions of 
the List, the Office will inform the 
relevant foreign governments of their 
presence on the List and request their 
responses. The Office will review these 
responses and make a determination as 
to their relevance. The List, along with 
a listing of the sources used to identify 
the goods and countries on it, will be 
published in the Federal Register and 
on the DOL Web site. The List will 
represent DOL’s conclusions based on 
all relevant information available at the 
time of publication. 

For each entry, the List will indicate 
whether the good is made using child 
labor, forced labor, or both. As the List 
continues to be maintained and 
updated, the List will also indicate the 
date when each entry was included. The 
List will not include any company or 
individual names. DOL’s postings on its 
website of source material used in 
identifying goods and countries on the 
List will be redacted to remove 
company or individual names, and 
other confidential material, pursuant to 
applicable laws and regulations. 
B. Procedures for the Maintenance of 
the List 

1. Following publication of the initial 
List, the Office will periodically review 
and update the List, as appropriate. The 
Office conducts ongoing research and 
monitoring of child labor and forced 
labor, and if relevant information is 
obtained through such research, the 
Office may add an entry to, or remove 
an entry from the List using the process 
described in section A of the 
Guidelines. The Office may also update 
the List on the basis of public 
information submissions, as detailed 
below. 

2. Any party may at any time file an 

information submission with the Office 
regarding the addition or removal of an 
entry from the List. Submitters should 
take note of the criteria and instructions 
in the ‘‘Information Requested on Child 
Labor and Forced Labor’’ section of this 
notice, as well as the criteria listed in 
Section A of the Guidelines. 

3. The Office will review any 

submission of information to determine 
whether it provides relevant and 
probative information. 

4. The Office may consider a 

submission less reliable if it determines 
that: the submission does not clearly 
indicate the source(s) of the information 
presented; the submission does not 
identify the party filing the submission

or is not signed and dated; the 
submission does not provide relevant or 
probative information; or, the 
information is not within the scope of 
the TVPRA and/or does not address 
child labor or forced labor as defined 
herein. All submissions received will be 
made available to the public on the DOL 
Web site, consistent with applicable 
laws or regulations. 

5. In evaluating a submission, the 

Office will conduct further examination 
of available information relating to the 
good and country, as necessary, to assist 
the Office in making a determination 
concerning the addition or removal of 
the good from the List. The Office will 
undertake consultations with relevant 
U.S. government agencies and foreign 
governments, and may hold a public 
hearing for the purpose of receiving 
relevant information from interested 
persons. 

6. In order for an entry to be removed 

from the List, any person filing 
information regarding the entry must 
provide information that demonstrates 
that there is no significant incidence of 
child labor or forced labor in the 
production of the particular good in the 
country in question. In evaluating 
information on government, industry, or 
third-party actions and initiatives to 
combat child labor or forced labor, the 
Office will consider particularly 
relevant and probative any available 
evidence of government, industry, and 
third-party actions that are effective in 
significantly reducing if not eliminating 
child labor and forced labor. 

7. Where the Office has made a 

determination concerning the addition, 
maintenance, or removal of the entry 
from the List, and where otherwise 
appropriate, the Office will publish an 
updated List in the Federal Register and 
on the DOL Web site. 
C. Key Terms Used in the Guidelines 

‘‘Child Labor’’—‘‘Child labor’’ under 
international standards means all work 
performed by a person below the age of 
15. It also includes all work performed 
by a person below the age of 18 in the 
following practices: (A) All forms of 
slavery or practices similar to slavery, 
such as the sale or trafficking of 
children, debt bondage and serfdom, or 
forced or compulsory labor, including 
forced or compulsory recruitment of 
children for use in armed conflict; (B) 
the use, procuring, or offering of a child 
for prostitution, for the production of 
pornography or for pornographic 
purposes; (C) the use, procuring, or 
offering of a child for illicit activities in 
particular for the production and 
trafficking of drugs; and (D) work 
which, by its nature or the 

circumstances in which it is carried out, 
is likely to harm the health, safety, or 
morals of children. The work referred to 
in subparagraph (D) is determined by 
the laws, regulations, or competent 
authority of the country involved, after 
consultation with the organizations of 
employers and workers concerned, and 
taking into consideration relevant 
international standards. This definition 
will not apply to work specifically 
authorized by national laws, including 
work done by children in schools for 
general, vocational or technical 
education or in other training 
institutions, where such work is carried 
out in accordance with international 
standards under conditions prescribed 
by the competent authority, and does 
not prejudice children’s attendance in 
school or their capacity to benefit from 
the instruction received. 

‘‘Countries’’—‘‘Countries’’ means any 

foreign country or territory, including 
any overseas dependent territory or 
possession of a foreign country, or the 
Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. 

‘‘Forced Labor’’—‘‘Forced labor’’ 

under international standards means all 
work or service which is exacted from 
any person under the menace of any 
penalty for its nonperformance and for 
which the worker does not offer himself 
voluntarily, and includes indentured 
labor. ‘‘Forced labor’’ includes work 
provided or obtained by force, fraud, or 
coercion, including: (1) By threats of 
serious harm to, or physical restraint 
against any person; (2) by means of any 
scheme, plan, or pattern intended to 
cause the person to believe that, if the 
person did not perform such labor or 
services, that person or another person 
would suffer serious harm or physical 
restraint; or (3) by means of the abuse 
or threatened abuse of law or the legal 
process. For purposes of this definition, 
forced labor does not include work 
specifically authorized by national laws 
where such work is carried out in 
accordance with conditions prescribed 
by the competent authority, including: 
any work or service required by 
compulsory military service laws for 
work of a purely military character; 
work or service which forms part of the 
normal civic obligations of the citizens 
of a fully self-governing country; work 
or service exacted from any person as a 
consequence of a conviction in a court 
of law, provided that the said work or 
service is carried out under the 
supervision and control of a public 
authority and that the said person is not 
hired to or placed at the disposal of 
private individuals, companies or 
associations; work or service required in 
cases of emergency, such as in the event 
of war or of a calamity or threatened 

calamity, fire, flood, famine, earthquake, 
violent epidemic or epizootic diseases, 
invasion by animal, insect or vegetable 
pests, and in general any circumstance 
that would endanger the existence or 
the well-being of the whole or part of 
the population; and minor communal 
services of a kind which, being 
performed by the members of the 
community in the direct interest of the 
said community, can therefore be 
considered as normal civic obligations 
incumbent upon the members of the 
community, provided that the members 
of the community or their direct 
representatives have the right to be 
consulted in regard to the need for such 
services. 

‘‘Goods’’—‘‘Goods’’ means goods, 

wares, articles, materials, items, 
supplies, and merchandise. 

‘‘Indentured Labor’’—‘‘Indentured 

labor’’ means all labor undertaken 
pursuant to a contract entered into by an 
employee the enforcement of which can 
be accompanied by process or penalties. 

‘‘International Standards’’— 

‘‘International standards’’ means 
generally accepted international 
standards relating to forced labor and 
child labor, such as international 
conventions and treaties. These 
Guidelines employ definitions of ‘‘child 
labor’’ and ‘‘forced labor’’ derived from 
international standards. 

‘‘Produced’’—‘‘Produced’’ means 
mined, extracted, harvested, farmed, 
produced, created, and manufactured. 
Information Requested on Child Labor 
and Forced Labor 

DOL requests current information 
about the nature and extent of child 
labor and forced labor in the production 
of goods internationally, as well as 
information on government, industry, or 
third-party actions and initiatives to 
address these problems. Information 
submitted may include studies, reports, 
statistics, news articles, electronic 
media, or other sources. Submitters 
should take into consideration the 
‘‘Sources of Information and Factors 
Considered in the Development and 
Maintenance of the List’’ (Section A of 
the Procedural Guidelines), as well as 
the definitions of child labor and forced 
labor contained in section C of the 
Guidelines. 

Information tending to establish the 

presence or absence of a significant 
incidence of child labor or forced labor 
in the production of a particular good in 
a country will be considered the most 
relevant and probative. Governments 
that have ratified International Labor 
Organization (‘‘ILO’’) Convention 138 
(Minimum Age), Convention 182 (Worst 
Forms of Child Labor), Convention 29

DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 

Bureau of Labor Statistics 

Proposed Collection; Comment 
Request 

ACTION: Notice. 
SUMMARY: The Department of Labor, as 
part of its continuing effort to reduce 
paperwork and respondent burden, 
conducts a pre-clearance consultation 
program to provide the general public 
and Federal agencies with an 
opportunity to comment on proposed 
and/or continuing collections of 
information in accordance with the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(PRA95) [44 U.S.C. 3506(c) (2)(A)]. This 
program helps to ensure that requested 
data can be provided in the desired 
format, reporting burden (time and 
financial resources) is minimized, 
collection instruments are clearly 
understood, and the impact of collection 
requirements on respondents can be 
properly assessed. Currently, the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics (BLS) is soliciting 
comments concerning the proposed 
revision of the ‘‘Current Population 
Survey (CPS).’’ A copy of the proposed 
information collection request (ICR) can 
be obtained by contacting the individual 
listed below in the ADDRESSES section of 
this notice. 
DATES: Written comments must be 
submitted to the office listed in the 
Addresses section below on or before 
February 25, 2008. 
ADDRESSES: Send comments to Amy A. 
Hobby, BLS Clearance Officer, Division 
of Management Systems, Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, Room 4080, 2 
Massachusetts Avenue, NE., 
Washington, DC 20212, 202–691–7628.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Amy A. Hobby, BLS Clearance Officer, 
202–691–7628. (See ADDRESSES section.) 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 

The CPS has been the principal 
source of the official Government 

statistics on employment and 
unemployment for over 60 years. The 
labor force information gathered 
through the survey is of paramount 
importance in keeping track of the 
economic health of the Nation. The 
survey is the only source of monthly 
data on total employment and 
unemployment, with the Employment 
Situation report containing data from 
this survey being a Primary Federal 
Economic Indicator (PFEI). Moreover, 
the survey also yields data on the basic 
status and characteristics of persons not 
in the labor force. The CPS data are used 
monthly, in conjunction with data from 
other sources, to analyze the extent to 
which, and with what success, the 
various components of the American 
population are participating in the 
economic life of the Nation. 

The labor force data gathered through 

the CPS are provided to users in the 
greatest detail possible, in conjunction 
with the demographic information 
obtained in the survey. In brief, the 
labor force data can be broken down by 
sex, age, race and ethnic origin, marital 
status, family composition, educational 
level, and other characteristics. 
Beginning in 2009, a breakdown by 
disability status will also be possible. 
Through such breakdowns, one can 
focus on the employment situation of 
specific population groups as well as on 
general trends in employment and 
unemployment. Information of this type 
can be obtained only through 
demographically oriented surveys such 
as the CPS. 

The basic CPS data also are used as 

an important platform on which to base 
the data derived from the various 
supplemental questions that are 
administered in conjunction with the 
survey. By coupling the basic data from 
the monthly survey with the special 
data from the supplements, one can get 
valuable insights on the behavior of 
American workers and on the social and 
economic health of their families. 

There is wide interest in the monthly 

CPS data among Government 
policymakers, legislators, economists, 
the media, and the general public. 
While the data from the CPS are used in 
conjunction with data from other 
surveys in assessing the economic 
health of the Nation, they are unique in 
various ways. Specifically, they are the 
basis for much of the monthly 
Employment Situation report, a PFEI. 
They provide a monthly, nationally 
representative measure of total 
employment, including farm work, self- 
employment and unpaid family work; 
other surveys are generally restricted to 
the nonagricultural wage and salary 
sector, or provide less timely
